The following resources have been provided to explain the purpose of the PMHC
MDS, to describe all data collected and file formats required to upload the
data.

### 1. Overview of purpose, design, scope and key decision issues
[The overview paper](/doc/pmhc-mds-overview-20160916.pdf) outlines the approach taken
in the design of the PMHC MDS and associated reporting arrangements.

### 2. Specifications
[The documentation website](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/) defines what data items
are collected in the PMHC MDS, what file formats are accepted for upload and
associated reporting requirements.

### 3. Ongoing questions and answers
[The ongoing questions and answers document](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/concepts-processes/)
provides the Department's responses to issues raised by PHNs
about the PMHC MDS. It will be updated regularly as new issues are raised by
PMHC MDS users.

### 4. Guidance on client consent
[The guidance on client consent](/doc/pmhc-consent-guidance-D16-1362220-20161202.pdf) provides suggested wording that PHNs may
wish to include in client consent forms provided to referrers and

planning and improving mental health services.

### 5. Outcome measures and scoring rules

### 6. Service Provider Quick Reference Guide
The Primary Mental Healthcare Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) Service Provider QUICK
REFERENCE Guide is a resource intended to describe key issues and concepts related to the collection of, and provision of data to, the PMHC MDS for mental health service providers. For
more detailed information regarding the PMHC MDS, see the [Data Specifications](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/).

There are two versions of the PMHC MDS Service Provider Quick Reference Guide.
If you are a service provider, it is recommended that you use the [PDF version](/doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide-20170516.pdf) produced by
the Department of Health. If you are a Primary Health Network, you can use the [word version](/doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide-template-20170516.docx) to tailor some of the information to your local context.

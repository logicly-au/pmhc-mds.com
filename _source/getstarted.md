Primary contact users at all PHN's have now been provided with accounts.

PHN's should now be creating Provider Organisations and, if required, setting
up users at these Provider Organisations.

Provided here is a list of steps required for users at Provider Organisations
to obtain access and upload/enter data to the PMHC MDS.

### <a name="steps"></a>What steps does each Provider Organisation need to take before they can upload or enter data to the PMHC MDS?

#### <a name="step1"></a>Step 1. Decide whether to upload or manually enter data

Data can either be uploaded via an Excel spreadsheet or CSV files, or manually entered into the PMHC MDS. Each organisation will need to decide which method they will use.

#### <a name="step2"></a>Step 2. If uploading, decide how to create upload files for the PMHC MDS

Before uploading data, each Provider Organisation, in conjunction with their PHN,
will need to analyse the data requirements and either organise
to have their client management systems altered to produce the files required
for upload or understand how to manually create the required Excel spreadsheets.
Please refer to the [Upload specification](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/upload-specification.html).

#### <a name="step3"></a>Step 3. Update client forms

Before uploading or entering data, each Provider Organisation, in conjunction with their PHN,
will need to update their client forms in order to collect all
the data required for the PMHC MDS. Please refer to the [data specification](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/)
and notes on [creating forms](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/form-creation.html).

#### <a name="step4"></a>Step 4. Obtain an account on the PMHC MDS

A user at a Provider Organisation will need to contact a user at their PHN who has the 'User Management' role and request that they create a new user account.

If the Provider Organisation is uploading data, the user will need to request the 'Upload' role.

If the Provider Organisation is manually entering data, the user will need to request the ‘Data Entry’ role.

If you are unsure who to contact at your PHN please contact the [PMHC MDS Helpdesk](mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com).

Once this user account has been created and you have been granted the appropriate role, you are ready to upload/enter data.

Please note, A PHN may also decide to assign the ‘User Management’ role to a user at the Provider Organisation, which will allow the Provider Organisation to manage their users and users roles.

#### <a name="step5"></a>Step 5. Training and online user guide

The PMHC MDS offers various options for users to learn how to navigate and use the PMHC MDS.

1. [Online User Guide](#user_guide)
2. [Online group training sessions](#group_training)
3. A video training library is coming soon and will be released in 2017

##### <a name="user_guide"></a>Online User Guide

The [Online User Guide](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/index.html)
is regularly updated to reflect each update release and outlines
step by step instructions for each role within the PMHC MDS.

##### <a name="group_training"></a>Online group training

Online group training sessions are currently hosted by the PMHC Helpdesk.

Access to the PMHC MDS is based around roles, and therefore online group
training sessions have been designed for a role. The following provides a
summary of each of the roles that we currently provide training for:

<table class="table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Tasks allowed</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User Management</td>
    <td>A user with the User Management role for an organisation can manage user accounts for that organisation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Upload</td>
    <td>A user with the Upload role can upload data to the associated organisation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data Entry</td>
    <td>A user with the Data Entry role can enter client data and practitioners from the associated organisation</td>
  </tr>
</table>

*Unsure which role you have? More information can be found at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/users.html#users-roles](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/users.html#users-roles).*

Online training sessions are held through an online GoToMeeting session. Each
session will be limited to approx. 25 users and can have a combination of
various Provider Organisation users from around Australia. Users can select
from the scheduled group training blocks offered throughout the following weeks,
as listed below.

To book in for an online training session please email [support@pmhc-mds.com](mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com)
with your preferred training date/time and a GoToMeeting link will be sent to
you via a calendar invitation.

Please note: Users who do not yet have an active login to the PMHC MDS can
still attend our training sessions. It would be very beneficial to organise
access prior to the training session, as this will then enable users to login
and commence using the PMHC MDS straight after the training session concludes.
*(More information on obtaining a login can be viewed in Step 4 above, or on
the PMHC MDS FAQS which can be found at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/access.html](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/access.html))*

Please email [support@pmhc-mds.com](mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com) with your preferred training date/time and
a GoToMeeting link will be sent to you via a calendar invitation.

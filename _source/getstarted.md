### What steps does each PHN need to take before they can upload data to the PMHC MDS?

#### Step 1. Decide how to create upload files for the PMHC MDS

Before the PMHC MDS goes live, each PHN, in conjunction with their provider
organisations, will need to analyse the data requirements and either organise
to have their client management systems altered to produce the files required
for upload or understand how to manually create the required Excel spreadsheets.

####  Step 2. Assign a primary contact

Before the PMHC MDS goes live each PHN needs to assign a primary contact. This
is the person who will have overall responsibility for PMHC MDS data management
within your PMHC.

A letter of authority is a request made on your PHN or Non-Government Health
Organisation's (NGHO) letterhead which must be signed by an authority at the
PHN or NGHO who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the
account is being created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).

This letter must contain the following details for the primary contact:

* Name
* Email address
* Mobile phone number
* Title/Position

This letter must be faxed to Strategic Data at (03) 9340 9090 or scanned then
emailed to [support@pmhc-mds.com](mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com).

An email address and a mobile phone number are required for security purposes
and will be used when the user initially sets their password or needs to reset
a forgotten password.

#### Step 3. Initial login

The PMHC MDS model allows PHNs to setup provider organisations underneath the
PHN.

When the primary contact user initially logs into the PMHC MDS they will need
to create each of these provider organisations. The information required about
each provider organisation is defined in the PMHC MDS specifications.

At least one user within each provider organisation will also need to be
created with the ‘Upload’ role so that provider organisations can upload data.

The PMHC MDS allows flexibility in the way in which PHNs devolve authority to
their provider organisations. In order to manage users a PMHC MDS user needs to
be granted the ‘User Management’ role. The primary contact user will be granted
this role and in turn they will be able to grant this role to any other user
within their PHN or the PHN’s provider organisations.

This means that PHNs can devolve user management authority to one or more users
in a provider organisation so that the provider organisation can manage their
own logins, or a PHN can choose to keep user management authority at the level
of the PHN requiring each provider organisation to contact the PHN when they
need a new user added.

Once the primary user has set up the provider organisations and associated user
accounts the PMHC MDS is ready for data upload. Separate data upload
documentation will be available.

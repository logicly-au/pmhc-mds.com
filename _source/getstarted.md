Primary contact users at all PHN's have now been provided with accounts. 

PHN's should now be creating Provider Organisations and, if required, setting 
up users at these Provider Organisations. 

Provided here is a list of steps required for users at Provider Organisations to obtain access and upload data 
to the PMHC MDS.

### What steps does each Provider Organisation need to take before they can upload data to the PMHC MDS?

#### Step 1. Decide how to create upload files for the PMHC MDS

Before uploading data, each Provider Organisation, in conjunction with their PHN,
will need to analyse the data requirements and either organise
to have their client management systems altered to produce the files required
for upload or understand how to manually create the required Excel spreadsheets.
Please refer to the <a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/upload-specification.html">upload specification</a>.

#### Step 2. Update client forms

Before uploading data, each Provider Organisation, in conjunction with their PHN,
will need to update their client forms in order to collect all
the data required for the PMHC MDS. Please refer to the
<a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/index.html">data specification</a> and notes on
<a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/form-creation.html">creating forms</a>.

#### Step 3. Obtain an account on the PMHC MDS

Before uploading data, a user at a Provider Organisation will need to contact a user
a their PHN who has the 'User Management' role and request that they create a new account
for the Provider Organisation user with the 'Upload' role. If you are unsure who to contact at your PHN
please contact the <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">PMHC MDS Helpdesk</a>.

Once this account has been created you are ready to upload data.

Please contact [support@pmhc-mds.com](mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com) if you have any questions or require training.

  <li>Totals for the B series reports are reported as 100% not â€˜-â€™, when appropriate.</li>
  <li>The B4 report is now only available to users who have the Reporting role at a PHN. It was not meaningful to users who only had a reporting role at a Provider Organisation.</li>
  <li>The C series reports now indicate whether counts or percentages are being displayed.</li>
  <li>The C1 report has been updated so that where the Client - Estimated Date of Birth Flag is set to code 8 (indicating that Date of Birth is a dummy date), records with this value will not have their Date of Birth converted to a valid age group but be mapped to â€˜Unknownâ€™.</li>

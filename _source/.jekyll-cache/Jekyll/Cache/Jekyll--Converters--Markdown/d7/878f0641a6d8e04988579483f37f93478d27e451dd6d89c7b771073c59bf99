</ul>

<h4 id="upload-api">Upload API</h4>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the PMHC MDS now supports an API for uploading
files to the PMHC MDS. Developers of Client Information Management Systems
(CIMS) can use the API to allow users to upload data to the PMHC MDS directly
from the CIMS instead of exporting a file and then logging into the PMHC MDS
to upload it.</p>

<p>Documentation is available at <a href="https://api.pmhc-mds.net/" target="_blank">https://api.pmhc-mds.net/</a></p>

<p>Access to this service requires an API key. In order to obtain a key, please
contact support@pmhc-mds.com.</p>

<p>Each integrator will be provided with their own unique API key which is
associated with a PMHC MDS user account and an organisation based “scope”.
The “scope” of the key and the roles the user is assigned in the PMHC MDS need
to match for the key to be valid. The scope is limited to one Provider
Organisation or PHN. An integrator will need to request multiple API keys if
they need access to upload across multiple Provider Organisations or multiple
PHNs.</p>

<p>The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available
at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/</a>.</p>

<p>In the last week of October 2021, the PMHC MDS will be updated with a change
to SIDAS outcome measures in uploads.</p>

<p>The PMHC MDS has been changing SIDAS outcome measures, such that if item 1
has the value “0 – Never”, all other items are set to 0.</p>

<p>Between now and the end of October, the PMHC MDS will change all other items
to “98 - Not Required”, when item 1 has the value  “0 – Never”. In the last
week of October, the PMHC MDS will be changed to enforce the validation rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When item 1 has the value “0 - Never” all other items must be set to “98 - Not Required”</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, when item 1 has the value “0 - Never” if any item has a value
other than “98 - Not Required” an error will be generated and the upload will fail.</p>

<p>We do not expect the outage to be longer than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.12.1 was released on
September 9, 2021.</p>

<p>The following changes have been implemented in the reports interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The estimated resident population figures used by the Acc-1, Acc-2, Acc-3
and App-1 reports have been updated to include data for each of the years
2017-2021. Reports will use the data from the year of the report, OR the
data from the most recent prior year if not available.</li>
  <li>Added a ‘View Report Code’ button to the results of reports using the PMHC
and hAPI data sources. This shows the underlying SQL that is used to
generate the report. Organisations who are trying to replicate the results
of reports locally can use this SQL to understand what data is being
included in each report.</li>
  <li>Added 2022 public holiday data for use in the Wayback reporting template.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following changes have been implemented in the upload and data entry interfaces:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated to v1.05 of the IAR-DST scoring inline with changes announced by
the Department of Health.</li>
  <li>Updated the SIDAS data entry form such that when item 1 - How often have
you had thoughts about suicide? - is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0: Never</code>, all other items are set
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">98: Not Required</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following bugfixes have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Outcome Measure date validation has been relaxed to allow an Outcome
Measure to be up to 7 days after the Episode End Date.</li>
  <li>Fixed an error that was being returned when a user at a PHN tried to
upload to an inactive Provider Organisation that was within the 3 month
grace period.</li>

      <h3>August 30, 2021</h3>
	    <h4 id="notification-of-planned-change-to-the-k10-scoring-calculation">Notification of planned change to the K10+ scoring calculation</h4>

<p>In the last week of October 2021, the PMHC MDS will be updated with a
changed K10+ scoring algorithm.</p>

<p>The PMHC MDS has been scoring the K10+ using the following algorithm:</p>

<p>The Total score is computed as the sum of the scores for items 1 to 10. If
any item has not been completed (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
it is excluded from the total with the proviso that a completed K10 with more
than one missing item is regarded as invalid.</p>

<p>Using this algorithm, a K10+ with one item missing and all other items scored
as 1 will be regarded as valid and have a total score of 9, however the K10+
Total Score is defined as being in the range 10-50.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, the scoring for the K10+ will be changed to a
pro-rated approach so that the minimum total score is 10. The following
formula will be used:</p>

<p>Total score = round( sum of valid scores  / 9 * 10 )</p>

<p>For more information please refer to page 58 of AMHOCN’s Overview of
clinician-rated and consumer self-report measures at <a href="https://www.amhocn.org/sites/default/files/publication_files/nocc_clinician_and_self-report_measures_overview_v2.1_20210913_1.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.amhocn.org/sites/default/files/publication_files/nocc_clinician_and_self-report_measures_overview_v2.1_20210913_1.pdf</a></p>

<p>Uploads that provide both the item scores and the total score will need to be
updated to use the new algorithm. Alternatively, uploads could be updated to
provide item scores and a total score of 99. Where item scores are provided
with a total of 99 the PMHC MDS will calculate the total score.</p>

<p>Where item scores have been provided, existing data will be recalculated to
use the new scoring.</p>

<p>We are also pleased to announce that changes have been made to improve the security
of PMHC MDS uploads.</p>

<p>Uploads will be rejected by our incoming data scanning system if they do not
meet the following requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Must be either an Excel Workbook (.xlsx),</li>
  <li>OR a zip (.zip) file containing CSV files,</li>
  <li>AND must be less than 512MB</li>
</ul>

<p>The first and second of these requirements were enforced already however
files will be rejected at an earlier stage in the process after this update
and as a consequence the behaviour of the system when files are rejected for
this reason will be slightly different.</p>

<p>The file size restriction prevents our systems from becoming unstable if
extremely large files are uploaded. We will monitor if this limit causes
issues for anyone and adjust it if necessary.</p>

      <h3>February 24, 2021</h3>
	    <p>On the evening of 25 February 2021 changes will be made to improve the security
of PMHC MDS uploads.</p>

<p>Uploads will be rejected by our incoming data scanning system if they do not
meet the following requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Must be either an Excel Workbook (.xlsx),</li>
  <li>OR a zip (.zip) file containing CSV files,</li>
  <li>AND must be less than 512MB</li>
</ul>

<p>The first and second of these requirements were enforced already however
files will be rejected at an earlier stage in the process after this update
and as a consequence the behaviour of the system when files are rejected for
this reason will be slightly different.</p>

<p>The file size restriction prevents our systems from becoming unstable if
extremely large files are uploaded. We will monitor if this limit causes
issues for anyone and adjust it if necessary.</p>

<p>The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available at:</p>

      <h3>February 23, 2021</h3>
	    <h4 id="headtohelp-hubs-data-specification-v302">HeadtoHelp Hubs Data Specification v3.0.2</h4>

<p>On 26 February 2021, a new field “Practitioner Level of Care” will be added
to the IAR-DST record of the HeadtoHelp Hubs PMHC MDS Extension.</p>

<p>In order to incorporate these changes, the upload specification for the
HeadtoHelp Hubs Data Specification will be updated.</p>

<p>A new field - Practitioner Level of Care - will be added to the IAR-DST record:</p>

<p>Description: The individualised level of care assessed by the practitioner for the referral</p>

<p>Field name: iar_dst_practitioner_level_of_care</p>

<p>Data type: string</p>

<p>Required: yes</p>

<p>Domain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1: Level 1 - Self Management</li>
  <li>2: Level 2 - Low Intensity Services</li>
  <li>3: Level 3 - Moderate Intensity Services</li>
  <li>4: Level 4 - High Intensity Services</li>
  <li>5: Level 5 - Acute and Specialist Community Mental Health Services</li>
  <li>9: Missing</li>
</ul>

<p>Existing IAR-DST data will have the Practitioner Level of Care set to 9: Missing.
All new data must use responses 1-5.</p>

      <h3>February 19, 2021</h3>
	    <p>As announced in the Department of Health’s circular on 16/2/2021, we are
pleased to announce that headspace data is now available through PMHC MDS
reports and data extracts.</p>

<p>For more information about the availability of headspace data in the PMHC
MDS please refer to the Department’s circular which has been published at

      <h3>February 16, 2021</h3>
	    <p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs on Tuesday 16 February 2021.</p>

<p>-----------------------</p>

<h4 id="primary-mental-health-care-minimum-data-set-circular-202101--january-2020">Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set Circular 2021/01 – January 2020</h4>

<h5 id="availability-of-headspace-data">Availability of headspace data</h5>

<h6 id="purpose">Purpose</h6>
<p>This circular outlines the availability of headspace (hAPI) data in the Primary
Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) for Primary Health Networks
(PHNs) from 19 February 2021. The data available will be from the period 2019-20.</p>

<p>The department has been working with headspace National (hN) and Strategic
Data to identify a technical solution to include hAPI data into the PMHC MDS.
The technical solution has been designed with the intent that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>headspace National will upload consented data to the PMHC-MDS on behalf of
all headspace centres</li>
  <li>PHNs will be able to view aggregate data and download consented unit record
data for the services they commission from headspace centres</li>
  <li>The department will be able to view aggregate data and download consented
unit record data for all headspace centres</li>
  <li>Local headspace centres will be able to view aggregate data and download
consented unit record data for their activity</li>
  <li>Data will be uploaded quarterly <strong>and will be available within a month of the
quarter’s completion</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This circular outlines the key technical issues to consider when using
headspace data.</p>

<h6 id="access-to-and-use-of-hapi-data">Access to and use of hAPI data</h6>

<p>The PMHC MDS concept of an episode requires that all service contacts and
collection occasions for an episode must occur at the same provider
organisation. In the headspace context, this would mean that all occasions of
service for any single episode would have to be delivered at a single
headspace centre.</p>

<p>headspace has a different episode model that allows episodes to span multiple
provider organisations and even multiple PHNs (primarily through the
introduction of satellite centres). In order to support the headspace model,
the <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headspace/en/v2/" target="_blank">PMHC MDS headspace specification</a> was designed to allow for
service contacts and collection occasions to be provided by a different
organisation to the organisation that initiated the episode.</p>

<p>The hAPI data is being made available in the PMHC MDS to support the
department, PHNs, hN and headspace centres in their role of monitoring and
reporting on delivery of primary mental health care.</p>

<h6 id="hapi-data-in-pmhc-mds">hAPI data in PMHC MDS</h6>

<p>There are a number of important factors to consider when reviewing hAPI data in the PMHC-MDS:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>hAPI data in the PMHC MDS <strong>only</strong> includes consented records. Therefore,
a report drawn from the PMHC MDS will likely differ from the quarterly
activity reports provided by headspace National or the headspace Tableau
dashboards which include all records as they are reported at an aggregate
centre and/or PHN level rather than at the individual level. Similarly,
any report directly sourced from a headspace centre may also differ if
they have included all records in their report.</p>

    <p>The headspace reports in tableau will continue to be available to PHNs and
will provide a full aggregated picture of activity at headspace centres.</p>

    <p>For information regarding consent please refer to the headspace extranet
 – ourspace, at <a href="https://headspaceaus.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/ourspace/resources/hapi/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Documents/Primary/hAPI%202.0%20Consent%20Text%20V2.0.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=gXgkr2" target="_blank">https://headspaceaus.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/ourspace/resources/hapi/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Documents/Primary/hAPI%202.0%20Consent%20Text%20V2.0.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=gXgkr2</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All data for an episode of care that has been delivered across multiple
headspace centres have been excluded from reports and data extracts. These
episodes represent a relatively small proportion of the total headspace
episodes (approximately 1%), however a limited number of centres and PHNs
will be more affected than others (particularly those with linked satellite
services). The Department will issue separate comms to the affected PHNs.
The Department is undertaking a review of the PMHC MDS episode model in
2021 to try and address this issue. In the meantime a new report has been
created, exclusively for hAPI data, that summarises the data excluded
because it is part of an episode delivered across multiple centres (report
A12, described below).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Category A-C PMHC-MDS standard reports have been modified to allow for
headspace specific reports. The Category D: Key Performance Indicators and
Category E: Reports for data managers to monitor data supply series have
not been modified as they are not pertinent for headspace. The A5 and B3
reports have had an extra ‘Funding Source’ selector added when viewing
headspace data. Two new reports have been added – an A12 – Episodes shared
across multiple organisations and B7 – Activity Report – hAPI Funding
Source. Details about all reports are available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html</a> has
been updated to include headspace reports.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h6 id="recording-headspace-centre-activity">Recording headspace centre activity</h6>

<p>With the availability of headspace centre data in the PMHC MDS, hAPI is the data
collection vehicle for all activity delivered in a headspace centre,
including services such as youth severe. As such, headspace centres will not
be required to submit data directly to the PMHC MDS for any activities
including those funded outside the core headspace contract. This is to
ensure headspace centres can meet their obligations and to avoid duplication
of records within the PMHC-MDS.</p>

<h6 id="headspace-centres">headspace centres</h6>

<p>headspace centres will be able to view reports but will not be able to read or
edit the unit record level data in the PMHC MDS system – only hN will have
that capacity. headspace centres will be able to download a version of their
own data at the unit record level to use for their own local purposes (e.g.
into spreadsheets for analysis, etc).</p>

<p>hN will liaise with Strategic Data for each of the headspace centres to gain
access to the PMHC MDS to view reports for their activity.</p>

<p>Detailed specifications can be found on the PMHC MDS website

<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.5.4 was released on December 23, 2020.</p>

<h5 id="headtohelp-hubs-extension">HeadtoHelp Hubs extension</h5>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) has been extended to allow data collection for the HeadtoHelp Hubs programs. This extension is only to be used if your organisation is a HeadtoHelp Hubs intake or hub organisation.</p>

<p>The HeadtoHelp Hubs specification is available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/</a>.</p>

<p>The PMHC MDS has been extended to allow upload, data entry and report filtering against this specification.</p>

<p>PHNs and their HeadtoHelp Hubs intake and hub provider organisations are able to either export data from their client systems and upload to the PMHC MDS or manually create spreadsheets that can then be uploaded. Example upload files are available in the HeadtoHelp Hubs Upload Specification at
<a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/data-specification/upload-specification.html" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/data-specification/upload-specification.html</a>.</p>

<p>Data may be uploaded in either Excel or CSV format.</p>

<p>There is a Developers PMHC MDS website available for testing/training purposes
for PHNs, Provider Organisations and third-party developers. See:
<a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/faqs/system/access.html#can-i-have-an-account-to-test-adding-data-and-for-training-new-staff" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/faqs/system/access.html#can-i-have-an-account-to-test-adding-data-and-for-training-new-staff</a>.</p>

<p>The HeadtoHelp Hubs data entry interface is also available. It allows users to manually enter HeadtoHelp Hubs data through online forms as an alternative to uploading a spreadsheet or file. The HeadtoHelp Hubs User Guide is available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/user-documentation/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/user-documentation/</a>. Information on adding HeadtoHelp data to an episode is available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/user-documentation/data-entry-user-guide.html#adding-a-client-s-headtohelp-episode-data" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/user-documentation/data-entry-user-guide.html#adding-a-client-s-headtohelp-episode-data</a></p>

<p>Reports have been updated so that they can filter episodes using either the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!br20</code> tag or the HeadtoHelp Hubs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!covid19</code> episode tag that has been introduced in order to support the Australian Government Mental Health HeadtoHelp Hubs program.

<p>The following bug fixes been implemented in the reporting tab:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug so that only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!wayback</code> tagged records are included in The Way Back
quarterly reports.</li>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) has been extended to
allow data collection for specific programs. These specifications are only to be
used if your organisation is providing services under the program.</p>

<h5 id="the-way-back-support-service">The Way Back Support Service</h5>

<p>People who have attempted suicide or experienced a suicidal crisis often
experience severe distress in the days and weeks immediately afterwards, and
they are at high risk of attempting again.</p>

<p>Beyond Blue developed The Way Back Support Service to support them through this
critical risk period. A Support Coordinator contacts the person within one
business day of receiving their referral and tailors a program for up to three
months after discharge from hospital. This program is built on personal
connection and integration with community services.</p>

<p>On 1 July 2019, a new field “Continuity of Support” will be added to the Episode record of the PMHC MDS.</p>

<p>In order to incorporate these changes, the upload specification for the PMHC MDS will be updated.
As of the 1 July 2019, the PMHC MDS will accept uploads in both the current 1.0 format and a
new 2.0 format as documented at http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/.</p>

<p>A summary of the changes between version 1.0 and 2.0 are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Version 2.0 introduces a new metadata file or worksheet.
In version 1.0 a version number had to be specified as the first row in every
row/worksheet. This row has been removed from version 2.0 and the version
number has been moved into a separate worksheet.
See https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/upload-specification.html#metadata-file</p>
  </li>
  <li>The following new fields will be added to the Organisation record:
    <ul>
      <li>Start Date</li>
      <li>End Date</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following field will be retired from the Organisation record:
    <ul>
      <li>Provider Organisation Status</li>

  </li>
  <li>The following new field will be added to the Episode record:

      <h3>June 21, 2017</h3>
	    <p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs on Tuesday 20 June 2017.</p>

<p>-----------------------</p>

<p>Dear PHN CEOs,</p>

<p>From 1 July 2017, PHNs are expected to be uploading data into the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS). The following provides CEOs an update on the transition to full compliance and the master client index.</p>

<h4 id="transition-to-full-compliance">Transition to Full Compliance</h4>

<p>Previous communications have indicated that the existing Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) / Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) MDS would be shut down when the PMHC MDS data entry interface was implemented. Due to difficulties in converting the data between the two systems, the ATAPS/MHSRA system will continue until further notice.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2017, full compliance with the PMHC MDS is still expected. However, this means all consenting clients referred for mental health services from 1 July 2017 have information entered into the PMHC MDS. Existing clients whose data has been entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS may continue to do so. However, new referrals should NOT be entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS from 1 July 2017.</p>

<p>Options for reporting and transferring active ATAPS referrals into the new PMHC MDS have been considered by the PMHC MDS Working Group and three options have been agreed for addressing the needs. Each PHN must choose only one option, their preferred option, of the three presented below.</p>

<p>Once selected, please have your PMHC MDS Data Primary User advise your preferred option to Strategic Data at <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 1 July 2017. Strategic Data will then work with the PHN on their preferred option.</p>

<h5 id="option-one">Option one</h5>

<p>The ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS will be kept online for up to 12 months to allow for those existing client referrals already receiving services under the old ‘ATAPS’ system to be maintained until all sessions associated with that referral are complete.</p>

<p>This option requires PHNs and their organisations to work with two data collections, ie: The PMHC MDS for new clients / episodes commencing post 1 July 2017 and the old ATAPS system for existing clients who have not completed their treatment.</p>

<h5 id="option-two">Option two</h5>

<p>Strategic Data will provide the PHN an <em>ATAPS MDS data extract in PMHC MDS upload format</em>. The extract will contain ATAPS clients and their associated data where a client had an associated session in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Note that, ATAPS does not associate clients with provider organisations, which is a structural element required for the PMHC MDS. Therefore, the organisation path in this extract will be empty and the PHN will need to assign each client to their correct provider organisation. Any other data which cannot be mapped from ATAPS to PMHC data definitions will be set as missing. Each record will have the ‘!ATAPS’ tag added so records exported from ATAPS can be identified in future analysis.</p>

<p>This option will require significant work by the PHN to assign provider organisations to each client and significant amounts of missing data on the migrated clients.</p>

<h5 id="option-three">Option three</h5>

<p>Where PHNs are implementing new clients systems, they may choose to map the ATAPS data to PMHC data and then upload to the PMHC MDS directly from their client system. PHNs choosing this option will be provided with specifications of the <em>mapping of ATAPS to PMHC format</em> being used to produce the ATAPS MDS data extract at option two. This option requires PHNs to follow this mapping format to provide consistency in mapped ATAPS data.</p>

<h4 id="master-client-index">Master Client Index</h4>

<p>The current PMHC MDS specification requires a Client Key that is unique and stable at the PHN regional level, not at the provider organisation level. The purpose of the Master Client Index is to help PHNs and their provider organisations manage client information across the PHN region. This requirement has proven problematic for PHNs and is being worked through by the PMHC MDS Working Group.</p>

<p>To determine what issues exist with managing the client key and possible solutions, nine PHNs worked with Strategic Data to describe their models for triaging patients, the information systems being used by PHNs and provider organisations, the ease of updating information systems and resources available for manual reconciliation of clients.</p>

<p>As a result of this work, a Master Client Index is not possible at this time, and as such, will not be a requirement for full compliance from 1 July 2017. The requirement will now be organisational uniqueness instead of regional level uniqueness until this can be addressed.</p>

<p>The PMHC Working Group agrees that the opportunity for national and regional level uniqueness is an aspiration and will continue to be investigated by the Department. The Department is currently looking into the use of Healthcare Identifiers and will provide you with updates as this work progresses.</p>

<p>If you have any further queries, please email: <a href="mailto:mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au">mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The PMHC MDS Service Provider QUICK REFERENCE Guide is a resource intended to describe key issues and concepts related to the collection of, and provision of data to, the PMHC MDS for mental health service providers. For more detailed information regarding the PMHC MDS, see the <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/">PMHC MDS Data Specifications</a>.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the PMHC MDS Service Provider Quick Reference Guide. If you are a service provider, it is recommended that you use the <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide-20170619.pdf">PDF version</a> produced by the Department of Health. If you are a Primary Health Network, you can use the <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide-template-20170619.docx">word version</a> to tailor some of the information to your local context.</p>

        Let's discuss PMHC MDS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are fast approaching the end of the financial year.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) now focused on new and existing contracts with Provider Organisations (PO) we want to further clarify the timelines and requirements for the PMHC MDS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Department is aware that 2016-17 is a transitional year however 2017-18 is expected to have comprehensive mental health services data collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upload functionality has been available on the PMHC MDS since November 2016. All PHNs are expected to start uploading their data in preparation for 1 July 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next few weeks, data entry will start to be rolled out in a staged process. Data entry will be available in the following order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practitioners</li>
        <li>Clients</li>
        <li>Episodes</li>
        <li>Service Contacts</li>
        <li>K10+</li>
        <li>K5</li>
        <li>SDQ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Strategic Data have been working on the transitional development of an ATAPS data extract that will allow active ATAPS data to be exported to the PMHC MDS. More news on this process will be released soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you aren't sure what your PHN should be doing to be prepared for 1 July, please contact
        <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>
        and we'll organise a time to discuss options that would best suit your circumstances.

        <h4>
          Data Consistency Requirements for Manual Upload of File/Worksheet
        </h4>
        <p>
          Data elements for each file/worksheet are defined at
          <a title="PMHC MDS Data Record FormatsSpecification " href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#record-formats">Record Formats</a>

          please note the following important points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="bold"> <b> All files must be internally consistent.</b></li>
          <li> An example of what this means is that for every row in the episode file/worksheet, there should be a corresponding client in the client file/worksheet.</li>
          <li> It also means that for every episode included in an upload file, you must include <b> ALL </b> service contacts and collection occasions for that episode. Any service contacts and collection occasions, for that episode, that are not included will be removed from the PMHC MDS. <b>Please note: It is no longer true that service contacts and collection occasions that are not included will be removed.

      <h3>
        What are the hot topics?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The PMHC MDS Helpdesk has had a few similar enquiries from various PHNs recently, and we thought it would be valuable to share these.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Specification Definitions
			</h4>
      <p>
        Each data item has associated notes that provide guidance on which response to use. By clicking on the <a title="PMHC MDS Data Record FormatsSpecification " href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#record-formats">Record Formats</a> field name this will take you to the field definition which outlines the associated notes.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Client Consent
			</h4>
      <p>
        All data can be uploaded to the PMHC MDS, regardless of the consent flag.  We have added more details to the Client consent information to explain how this data will be managed by the PMHC MDS -
        <a title="Definition of 'Episode - Client Consent to Anonymised Data'" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#episode-client-consent-to-anonymised-data">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h4>
        First Uploads
			</h4>
      <p>
        Now is the right time for PHNs and Provider Organisations to be testing uploads. Start small and test how the system responds to ensure that you have the base file format fundamentals for the uploads file/worksheet. Once the initial small uploads are successful, you'll find it much easier to roll out the system from there. For Upload Specification information -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Upload File Format Specification" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/upload-specification.html#">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h4>
        PHNs can request a 'Test' Organisation
			</h4>
      <p>
        If PHNs would like to set up a test organisation for initial upload tests with fictitious/test data, then PHNs can request one to be created on the separate Developers PMHC MDS.  Just follow the instructions as outlined for software developers -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Annoucement for Developers site" href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2017/02/17/Separate-PMHC-MDS-now-available-for-software-developers-to-test-upload-files/">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h4>
        Client Key
			</h4>
      <p>
        We understand that PHNs are having difficulty with the requirement for there to be a stable and unique client key across their provider organisations. This is the problem that the Master Client Index (MCI) is being designed to help with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strategic Data have analysed the feedback from the one on one discussions with the volunteer PHNs, and passed this feedback onto The Department of Health. Options are currently being discussed. Once a decision has been reached it will be communicated to all PHNs.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Reporting timelines
			</h4>
      <p>
        The PMHC MDS won't remind users to upload data. PHNs will receive reporting dates from the Department. PHNs will need to manage within their own systems and remind Provider Organisations to upload if required.  We have listed a minimum expectation for upload timelines on the PMHC documentation site -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Reporting timelines" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/reporting-arrangements.html#reporting-timeliness">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h4>
        ATAPS news list communication
			</h4>
      <p>
        The ATAPS mailing list will no longer receive messages from the evaluation team at The University of Melbourne reminding them to upload data. This has caused some recent confusion for current Provider Organisations who are reporting data to the old ATAPS MDS. It is the responsibility of PHNs to manage the data that is entered into the ATAPS MDS.

      <h4>
        Milestone Releases
      </h4>
      <p>
        From recent Helpdesk PHN enquiries and discussions, Strategic Data has been able to advocate that for PHNs the Data Entry interface is more important to them than the Outcome Measures Self Service Interface. The Department has approved this development priority change and Strategic Data resources have been moved accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get Data Entry functionality to PHNs as soon as possible, development of this feature has been split into several components.  The first of these, Viewing Client Data, was released in <a title="PMHC MDS v0.9.2 News Annoucement" href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2017/05/18/Update-to-the-PMHC-MDS-v0-9-2-and-Data-Specifications-v1-0-6/">v0.9.2</a>.  As mentioned above, the remaining features will be rolled out iteratively over the coming weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next Milestone Releases will be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practitioners Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Client Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Episode Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Service Contacts Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>K5 and K10+ Outcome Measures Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>SDQ Outcome Measures Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Online K5 and K10+ Outcome Measures Self-Service Interface</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reporting is still in the early stages of development. Initial reports will be designed to assist data managers monitor the data that has been uploaded/entered into the PMHC MDS.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Stage Two
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once data entry has been implemented we will continue to focus on the remaining <a title="PMHC MDS Stage Two Development" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/development.html#development-of-the-pmhc-minimum-data-set">Stage Two</a> developments. Releases for these items will continue throughout this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once more information is available, we will circulate more specific timelines. Please regularly check the announcements on the <a title="PMHC MDS Home Page" href="https://pmhc-mds.com/#/">PMHC MDS home page</a> to keep informed.

      <h3>March 29, 2017</h3>
	    <p>Stage 2 development of the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS)  is currently underway. A requirement of the PMHC MDS is that a client key must be unique within each Primary Health Network (PHN) independent of the treating organisation. It is the responsibility of PHNs and Provider Organisations to co-ordinate to maintain this identifier. Clients should not be assigned multiple keys within the same PHN.</p>

<p>In order to help maintain the client key, a component of Stage 2 is to develop a Master Client Index (MCI). It is envisaged that Provider Organisations will be able to access the MCI in order to locate existing clients at other Provider Organisations with the same PHN and match the client key, or create a new client if the client does not yet exist in the MCI.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the MCI meets the needs of PHNs and Provider Organisations we would like to discuss the requirements with a volunteer group of PHNs and their Provider Organisations. These discussions would take the form of teleconferences and possibly one on one phone calls.</p>

<p>Organisations who are willing to volunteer are requested to email <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 7 April 2017.</p>

        The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) is live and ready for you to use in a way that best suits your organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) well underway to understanding how they will manage the PMHC MDS and developing best practice principles around collecting data, it is always a good opportunity to revisit the big picture discussion points. We have
        listed these on
        <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/getstarted/" title="How to get started on the PMHC MDS">Getting Started on the PMHC MDS</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need a bit of inspiration or just want to ensure that you are on the right track with rolling out the PMHC MDS, please feel free to send the PMHC MDS Helpdesk an email on
        <a title="PMHC Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> to organise a time to chat further with us to answer any lingering question you may have. We are here to help make this transition
        as seamless as possible and it is also a great opportunity for us to understand what could be causing obstacles to PHNs.

        </h4>
        <p>
          To avoid the invitation email and/or SMS token being deleted, it is always best to notify a user that you will be sending them a PMHC MDS invitation. Inform them that they will receive an invitation by email from noreply@strategicdata.com and a verification
          code via SMS. Please also provide them with the link to the online

        </li>
        <li>If the user has incorrectly entered their token after several attempts, this will cause the previous token to be invalid, then you will no longer receive this message and the invitation will be able to be resent

        Let us delve into the developer's world - If you are game then we are too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you have had the opportunity to see the basic PMHC MDS in the December training sessions, I'm sure you are all keen to hear more on what is currently in the development pipeline, and there are a lot of exciting features currently consuming our
        developers' time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The below milestones have been set with new releases to become a regular occurrence. Some features may be a lot of work for a back end developer but will offer minimal visual impact to the current user interface, others will have a significant change
        to the look and will streamline user functionality, or to provide additional and much awaited tools to the website.
      </p>
      <h4>Next Milestone Releases will be:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Limit organisation structure to two levels</li>
        <li>View Client Data</li>
        <li>Online K5 client/practitioner tool</li>
        <li>Basic Summary Reports</li>
        <li>Online K10+ and SDQ client/practitioner tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our long term goal is still focussed on Stage Two release. As the Department has previously announced, it is scheduled for mid 2017 and will feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Comprehensive Reports</li>
        <li>Master Client Index</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are continually trying to improve the user experience, and greatly appreciate your questions, feedback and suggestions, so please don't hesitate to drop us a line or two at <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.

      <div id="/2016/10/14/PMHC-MDS-Request-for-early-adopters/"><h2>UPDATE regarding the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set - Request for nominations to be early adopters</h2></div>
      <h3>October 14, 2016</h3>
	    <p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs on Friday 14 October 2016.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>Dear PHN CEOs</p>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will be available for all Primary Health Networks (PHNs) to commence uploading data in early December. Prior to this we are looking for between 5 and 10 PHNs to volunteer as early adopters. These PHNs will commence upload from the 7th of November, and help us to streamline the system prior to making it available to all PHNs from the beginning of December.</p>

<p>We would like some of the early adopters to be uploading zipped csv files and some to be uploading Excel spreadsheets. They will need to be willing to provide feedback on the process used to give the primary contact user access to the system, the usability of the system, and the documentation and training.</p>

<p>Benefits of moving to the PMHC include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Early access to features which are not included in the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS:</li>
  <li>Partitioning of provider organisations within a PHN so that provider organisations can only access their own data.</li>
  <li>Delegation of user management to each provider organisation.</li>
  <li>Reduced data collection burden due to not needing to collect data items that have been retired from the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com?Subject=PMHC%20MDS%20Request%20for%20early%20adopters">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by Friday the 28th of October, 2016 if you would like to volunteer. PHNs who have been selected to be early adopters will be notified on Wednesday the 2nd of November, 2016.</p>

<p>Additionally there are still a few PHNs who have not yet submitted a ‘Letter of Authority’ it would be appreciated if you could address this as a matter of priority. If you are unsure we will be following up with individual PHN’s in the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

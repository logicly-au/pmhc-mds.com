<p>On 1 July 2019, a new field ‚ÄúContinuity of Support‚Äù will be added to the Episode record of the PMHC MDS.</p>

<p>In order to incorporate these changes, the upload specification for the PMHC MDS will be updated.
As of the 1 July 2019, the PMHC MDS will accept uploads in both the current 1.0 format and a
new 2.0 format as documented at http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/.</p>

<p>A summary of the changes between version 1.0 and 2.0 are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Version 2.0 introduces a new metadata file or worksheet.
In version 1.0 a version number had to be specified as the first row in every
row/worksheet. This row has been removed from version 2.0 and the version
number has been moved into a separate worksheet.
See https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/upload-specification.html#metadata-file</p>
  </li>
  <li>The following new fields will be added to the Organisation record:
    <ul>
      <li>Start Date</li>
      <li>End Date</li>
    </ul>

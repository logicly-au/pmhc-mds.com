allow multiple measures to be collected at a collection occasion.</li>

was inconsistent with the ‘Edit Details’ and ‘Add Details’ tabs.</li>

a copy of a service contact. The hover wording previously said ‘Duplicate
Service Contact’. It has been updated to ‘Copy as new service contact’ and
the icon has been moved to the right of the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following bug fixes have been implemented in the reporting interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the data selectors in the B3 report showed inconsistent
behaviour after clicking the ‘Back’ button from a previously generated B3 report.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following bug fixes have been implemented in the users interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the Expires and Last changed times on the User Details

the logged in user’s local timezone.</li>

</ul>

<p>The following features have been implemented in the data entry interface:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>The following updates and bug fixes have been implemented across the PMHC MDS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug where you could edit an Episode end date to make it earlier
than the date of an existing service contact or collection occasion date.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the SDQ totals were not displayed correctly when item scores had been provided.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the user roles were not displayed correctly at times.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where an error was incorrectly displayed when saving an Organisation record.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where if a partial set of organisation data is supplied in an
upload, and the practitioner data is not supplied, the practitioner data is
now generated in a consistent manner.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug for IE11 users getting blank pages with high security browser settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user guide has been updated to reflect these updates. It is available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/</a>.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.12.1 was released on
September 9, 2021.</p>

<p>The following changes have been implemented in the reports interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The estimated resident population figures used by the Acc-1, Acc-2, Acc-3
and App-1 reports have been updated to include data for each of the years
2017-2021. Reports will use the data from the year of the report, OR the
data from the most recent prior year if not available.</li>
  <li>Added a ‘View Report Code’ button to the results of reports using the PMHC
and hAPI data sources. This shows the underlying SQL that is used to
generate the report. Organisations who are trying to replicate the results
of reports locally can use this SQL to understand what data is being
included in each report.</li>
  <li>Added 2022 public holiday data for use in the Wayback reporting template.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following changes have been implemented in the upload and data entry interfaces:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated to v1.05 of the IAR-DST scoring inline with changes announced by
the Department of Health.</li>
  <li>Updated the SIDAS data entry form such that when item 1 - How often have
you had thoughts about suicide? - is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0: Never</code>, all other items are set
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">98: Not Required</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following bugfixes have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Outcome Measure date validation has been relaxed to allow an Outcome
Measure to be up to 7 days after the Episode End Date.</li>
  <li>Fixed an error that was being returned when a user at a PHN tried to
upload to an inactive Provider Organisation that was within the 3 month
grace period.</li>
</ul>

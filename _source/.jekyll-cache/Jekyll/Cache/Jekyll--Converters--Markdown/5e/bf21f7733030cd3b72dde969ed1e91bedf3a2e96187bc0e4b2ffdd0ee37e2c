<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) has been extended to
allow data collection for specific programs. These specifications are only to be
used if your organisation is providing services under the program.</p>

<h5 id="the-way-back-support-service">The Way Back Support Service</h5>

<p>People who have attempted suicide or experienced a suicidal crisis often
experience severe distress in the days and weeks immediately afterwards, and
they are at high risk of attempting again.</p>

<p>Beyond Blue developed The Way Back Support Service to support them through this
critical risk period. A Support Coordinator contacts the person within one
business day of receiving their referral and tailors a program for up to three
months after discharge from hospital. This program is built on personal
connection and integration with community services.</p>

<h5 id="stage-1---submitting-the-way-back-data-via-upload-only">STAGE 1 - Submitting The Way Back data via Upload only</h5>

<p>Stage 1 has been released in the PMHC MDS for Upload. During the initial stage
of implementing The Way Back records in the PMHC MDS, PHNs and their service
providers will be able to either export data from their client systems and
upload to the PMHC MDS or manually create spreadsheets that can then be uploaded.
Example upload files are available in The Way Back Upload Specification at
<a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/upload-specification.html" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/upload-specification.html</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Data may be uploaded in either Excel or CSV format.</strong></p>

<p>There is a Developers PMHC MDS website available for testing/training purposes
for PHNs, Provider Organisations and third-party developers. See:

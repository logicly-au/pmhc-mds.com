I"–<p>PMHC MDS Update v0.4.2 was released on November 29, 2016.</p>

<p>The â€˜User Managementâ€™ role has been split with a new role â€˜Organisation Managementâ€™ being created. Primary Contact users have had the â€˜Organisation Managementâ€™ role added to their account.</p>

<p>The â€˜User Managementâ€™ role now only allows a user to invite new users to use the PMHC MDS and also manage the roles that the user has. It no longer allows you to manage provider organisations.</p>

<p>The â€˜Organisation Managementâ€™ role allows a user to add and manage provider organisations.</p>

<p>The Primary Contact user will need to provide any other users at their organisations with the â€˜Organisation Managementâ€™ role if appropriate.</p>

<p>The user guide has been updated to reflect these roles, available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/</a></p>

I"‰<p>On 22 November 2017 we sent out an announcement that there would be a PMHC MDS system and network upgrade on Saturday 2 December between 10:00am and 2:00pm AEDT.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this upgrade has been delayed. We will now be performing system and network upgrades on Saturday 9 December between 10:00am and 2:00pm AEDT.</p>

<p>We do not expect any outage, but there is the possibility that an outage may
occur during this period.</p>

<p>If you are planning on uploading or entering any data during this time, we
advise you to complete your work before 10:00am AEDT.</p>

<p>Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v0.28.7 was released on April 8, 2019.</p>

<p>The following bugfixes have been implemented in the reporting interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Key Performance Indicator report â€˜App-1 - Youth receiving youth specific servicesâ€™ has been updated to only include episodes where the Principal Focus of Treatment Plan is â€˜Child and youth-specific mental health servicesâ€™.</li>
  <li>The Key Performance Indicator report â€˜App-1 - Youth receiving youth specific servicesâ€™ has been updated as it was missing a row for â€œNot stated/inadequately describedâ€ and incorrectly calculated the â€œTOTALâ€ row when disaggregated by ATSI status.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user guide has been updated to reflect these updates. It is available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/</a>.</p>

I"Œ<p>The PMHC MDS currently supports uploads in both the Version 1 format as documented at <a href="http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v1/" target="_blank">http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v1/</a> and the Version 2 format as documented at <a href="http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/" target="_blank">http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>After the 30th of June 2020 the PMHC MDS will no longer accept uploads using the Version 1 format.</strong> Please ensure that you have migrated to using the Version 2 format before this date.</p>

<p>A summary of the changes between version 1.0 and 2.0 are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Version 2.0 introduces a new metadata file or worksheet.
In version 1.0 a version number had to be specified as the first row in every
row/worksheet. This row has been removed from version 2.0 and the version
number has been moved into a separate worksheet.

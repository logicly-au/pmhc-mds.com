<p>In the last week of October 2021, the PMHC MDS will be updated with a change
to SIDAS outcome measures in uploads.</p>

<p>The PMHC MDS has been changing SIDAS outcome measures, such that if item 1
has the value â€œ0 â€“ Neverâ€, all other items are set to 0.</p>

<p>Between now and the end of October, the PMHC MDS will change all other items
to â€œ98 - Not Requiredâ€, when item 1 has the value  â€œ0 â€“ Neverâ€. In the last
week of October, the PMHC MDS will be changed to enforce the validation rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When item 1 has the value â€œ0 - Neverâ€ all other items must be set to â€œ98 - Not Requiredâ€</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, when item 1 has the value â€œ0 - Neverâ€ if any item has a value
other than â€œ98 - Not Requiredâ€ an error will be generated and the upload will fail.</p>

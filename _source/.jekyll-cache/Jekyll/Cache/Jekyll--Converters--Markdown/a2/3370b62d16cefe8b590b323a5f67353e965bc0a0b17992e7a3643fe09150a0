<h4 id="primary-mental-health-care-minimum-data-set-circular-202101--january-2020">Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set Circular 2021/01 – January 2020</h4>

<h5 id="availability-of-headspace-data">Availability of headspace data</h5>

<h6 id="purpose">Purpose</h6>
<p>This circular outlines the availability of headspace (hAPI) data in the Primary
Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) for Primary Health Networks
(PHNs) from 19 February 2021. The data available will be from the period 2019-20.</p>

<p>The department has been working with headspace National (hN) and Strategic
Data to identify a technical solution to include hAPI data into the PMHC MDS.
The technical solution has been designed with the intent that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>headspace National will upload consented data to the PMHC-MDS on behalf of
all headspace centres</li>
  <li>PHNs will be able to view aggregate data and download consented unit record
data for the services they commission from headspace centres</li>
  <li>The department will be able to view aggregate data and download consented
unit record data for all headspace centres</li>
  <li>Local headspace centres will be able to view aggregate data and download
consented unit record data for their activity</li>
  <li>Data will be uploaded quarterly <strong>and will be available within a month of the
quarter’s completion</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This circular outlines the key technical issues to consider when using
headspace data.</p>

<h6 id="access-to-and-use-of-hapi-data">Access to and use of hAPI data</h6>

<p>The PMHC MDS concept of an episode requires that all service contacts and
collection occasions for an episode must occur at the same provider
organisation. In the headspace context, this would mean that all occasions of
service for any single episode would have to be delivered at a single
headspace centre.</p>

<p>headspace has a different episode model that allows episodes to span multiple
provider organisations and even multiple PHNs (primarily through the
introduction of satellite centres). In order to support the headspace model,
the <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headspace/en/v2/" target="_blank">PMHC MDS headspace specification</a> was designed to allow for
service contacts and collection occasions to be provided by a different
organisation to the organisation that initiated the episode.</p>

<p>The hAPI data is being made available in the PMHC MDS to support the
department, PHNs, hN and headspace centres in their role of monitoring and
reporting on delivery of primary mental health care.</p>

<h6 id="hapi-data-in-pmhc-mds">hAPI data in PMHC MDS</h6>

<p>There are a number of important factors to consider when reviewing hAPI data in the PMHC-MDS:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>hAPI data in the PMHC MDS <strong>only</strong> includes consented records. Therefore,
a report drawn from the PMHC MDS will likely differ from the quarterly
activity reports provided by headspace National or the headspace Tableau
dashboards which include all records as they are reported at an aggregate
centre and/or PHN level rather than at the individual level. Similarly,
any report directly sourced from a headspace centre may also differ if
they have included all records in their report.</p>

    <p>The headspace reports in tableau will continue to be available to PHNs and
will provide a full aggregated picture of activity at headspace centres.</p>

    <p>For information regarding consent please refer to the headspace extranet
 – ourspace, at <a href="https://headspaceaus.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/ourspace/resources/hapi/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Documents/Primary/hAPI%202.0%20Consent%20Text%20V2.0.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=gXgkr2" target="_blank">https://headspaceaus.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/ourspace/resources/hapi/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Documents/Primary/hAPI%202.0%20Consent%20Text%20V2.0.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=gXgkr2</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All data for an episode of care that has been delivered across multiple
headspace centres have been excluded from reports and data extracts. These
episodes represent a relatively small proportion of the total headspace
episodes (approximately 1%), however a limited number of centres and PHNs
will be more affected than others (particularly those with linked satellite
services). The Department will issue separate comms to the affected PHNs.
The Department is undertaking a review of the PMHC MDS episode model in
2021 to try and address this issue. In the meantime a new report has been
created, exclusively for hAPI data, that summarises the data excluded
because it is part of an episode delivered across multiple centres (report
A12, described below).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Category A-C PMHC-MDS standard reports have been modified to allow for
headspace specific reports. The Category D: Key Performance Indicators and
Category E: Reports for data managers to monitor data supply series have
not been modified as they are not pertinent for headspace. The A5 and B3
reports have had an extra ‘Funding Source’ selector added when viewing
headspace data. Two new reports have been added – an A12 – Episodes shared
across multiple organisations and B7 – Activity Report – hAPI Funding
Source. Details about all reports are available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html</a> has
been updated to include headspace reports.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h6 id="recording-headspace-centre-activity">Recording headspace centre activity</h6>

<p>With the availability of headspace centre data in the PMHC MDS, hAPI is the data
collection vehicle for all activity delivered in a headspace centre,
including services such as youth severe. As such, headspace centres will not
be required to submit data directly to the PMHC MDS for any activities
including those funded outside the core headspace contract. This is to
ensure headspace centres can meet their obligations and to avoid duplication
of records within the PMHC-MDS.</p>

<h6 id="headspace-centres">headspace centres</h6>

<p>headspace centres will be able to view reports but will not be able to read or
edit the unit record level data in the PMHC MDS system – only hN will have
that capacity. headspace centres will be able to download a version of their
own data at the unit record level to use for their own local purposes (e.g.
into spreadsheets for analysis, etc).</p>

<p>hN will liaise with Strategic Data for each of the headspace centres to gain
access to the PMHC MDS to view reports for their activity.</p>

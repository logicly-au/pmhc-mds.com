<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.9.0 was released on
March 18, 2021.</p>

<p>The following functionality has been added to the data entry interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The data entry interface has been changed so that the user is presented
with a list of clients when they navigate to the data entry tab. Instead
of searching for a client, and then filtering, finding a client has been
reduced to a one step process of simply filtering.</li>
  <li>A ‘View Clients’ tab has been added to the ‘Practitioner Details’ tab to
allow viewing all the clients for a particular practitioner.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following functionality has been added to the reporting interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An extra report ‘W2: High level summary of overall volumes by entity has
been added to the Wayback reporting tab. This is a variation on the
‘A1: High level summary of overall volumes by entity’ report that is
tailored to filter on active episodes (episodes that have one or more
service contacts recorded in the period) that have an associated TWB
Episode record.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available at:</p>

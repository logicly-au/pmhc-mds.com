<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.15.7 was released on
March 31, 2022.</p>

<p>The following new validation has been implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All entity key fields (Organisation Key, Practitioner Key, Client Key, etc)
must start with a POSIX alphanumeric character (A-Za-z0-9)</p>

    <p>Some organisations have a small number of records that break this new
rule by starting entity keys with one of the characters [#-.`’+$”%_:] These
will cause issues if the data is modified. Please contact
support@pmhc-mds.com for assistance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available
at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/</a>.</p>

Plan to the three selected Lead PHNs</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the Suicide Referral icon was showing on episode
summaries where the Suicide Referral Flag was set to ‘Unknown’</li>

Provider Organisation with the Organisation Management role. This role is
restricted to PHN level.</li>
  <li>Added the Episode Key onto the Collection Occasion details/edit forms.</li>
  <li>Changed the sorting of Country of Birth and Main Language Spoken at Home so
that the top ten languages/country of births as reported in the 2011 census
are moved to the top of the list.</li>

<p>The following updates and bugfixes have been implemented in the upload
interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed an error in uploads when there was no practitioners file.</li>
  <li>Restricted the use of the ‘Complex Care Package’ Principal Focus of Treatment
Plan to the three selected Lead PHNs</li>
  <li>Improved the error message ‘Collection date must not be after Episode end
date’ so that it includes information about the episode key and collection
occasion key.</li>
  <li>Improved the error message ‘Client may not have multiple open episodes. This
client has an existing open episode within this organisation’ so that it
includes information about the client key and episode keys.</li>
  <li>Split the error message ‘Invalid episode_completion_status on row [x]. Where
service contact - final is recorded as “No further services planned” the
episode completion status should be recorded using one of the treatment
concluded responses.’ so that one message is returned when an episode has
a completion status but no end date and another error is returned when an
episode has an end date but no completion status.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved error messages like the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>…organisation_path / client_key value of “…” is invalid.</li>
      <li>…organisation_path / episode_key value of “…” is invalid.</li>
      <li>…organisation_path / practitioner_key value of “…” is invalid.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Return a sensible error instead of “episode: new row for relation “episode”
violates check constraint “end_after_referral” / Failing row contains (…).</li>
  <li>Return a sensible error instead of “client: new row for relation “client”
violates check constraint “past_date” / Failing row contains (…).</li>
</ul>

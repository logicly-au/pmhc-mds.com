<p>------------------</p>

<p>Dear PHN CEOs</p>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will be available for all Primary Health Networks (PHNs) to commence uploading data in early December. Prior to this we are looking for between 5 and 10 PHNs to volunteer as early adopters. These PHNs will commence upload from the 7th of November, and help us to streamline the system prior to making it available to all PHNs from the beginning of December.</p>

<p>We would like some of the early adopters to be uploading zipped csv files and some to be uploading Excel spreadsheets. They will need to be willing to provide feedback on the process used to give the primary contact user access to the system, the usability of the system, and the documentation and training.</p>

<p>Benefits of moving to the PMHC include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Early access to features which are not included in the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS:</li>
  <li>Partitioning of provider organisations within a PHN so that provider organisations can only access their own data.</li>
  <li>Delegation of user management to each provider organisation.</li>
  <li>Reduced data collection burden due to not needing to collect data items that have been retired from the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com?Subject=PMHC%20MDS%20Request%20for%20early%20adopters">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by Friday the 28th of October, 2016 if you would like to volunteer. PHNs who have been selected to be early adopters will be notified on Wednesday the 2nd of November, 2016.</p>

<p>Additionally there are still a few PHNs who have not yet submitted a ‘Letter of Authority’ it would be appreciated if you could address this as a matter of priority. If you are unsure we will be following up with individual PHN’s in the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

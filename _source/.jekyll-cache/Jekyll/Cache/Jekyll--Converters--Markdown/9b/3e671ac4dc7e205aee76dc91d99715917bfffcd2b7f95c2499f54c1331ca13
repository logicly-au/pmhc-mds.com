<h4 id="deletion-of-records-in-the-pmhc-mds">Deletion of records in the PMHC MDS</h4>

<p>Please note that deletion of records is being planned for a future release.
Deletion will be possible via both the data entry interface and uploads.
In order to allow organisations and third party developers to plan for
allowing deletion in uploads we have released the planned specification.
It is available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/upload-specification.html#deleting-records">Deleting records</a>. File format changes to accommodate deletion are backwards compatible with the current format.</p>

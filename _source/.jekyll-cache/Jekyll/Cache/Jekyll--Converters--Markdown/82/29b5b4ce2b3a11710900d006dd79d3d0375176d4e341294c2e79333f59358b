<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.4.0 was released on December
7, 2020.</p>

<p>The following new features have been implemented in the data extract tab:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Data Extract tab now includes a checkbox to â€˜Include data from all
specificationsâ€™. This downloads a file that is a combination of all of
the extensions listed at
<a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/</a>.
The resulting file <em>cannot</em> be uploaded. This is a download only format.
It is based on the most recent version used by either the core specification
or an extension.</li>
  <li>Optimisations have been applied to the data extract query to improve speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available at:</p>

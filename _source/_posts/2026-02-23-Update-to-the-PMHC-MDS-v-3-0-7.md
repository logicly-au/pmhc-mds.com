#### PMHC MDS Update v3.0.7 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v3.0.7 was released on 
February 23, 2026.

The following features have been applied in the data entry interface:
* Fixed a bug where Psychosocial could still be used as a Principal 
  Focus of Treatment for a new episode
* AMHC is no longer a valid response for new Intakes/Episodes for 
  the ’Organisation type referred to at Intake/Episode Conclusion‘ 
  field, but is still allowed for existing records. The 
  ‘HeadtoHelp / HeadtoHealth’ is similar but is still allowed for 
  new Intakes/Episodes for remaining temporary Head to Health 
  Clinics in New South Wales and Victoria. Fixed a bug when 
  displaying these fields where these options were applied to 
  existing records.
* Fixed an issue with the Veteran field defaulting to 
  “not stated/not adequately described”

The following updates have been applied in the upload interface:
* Fixed a bug with the UA Needs Identification worksheet name

The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available
at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/){:target="_blank"}.

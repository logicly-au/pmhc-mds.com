title: PMHC MDS Early Psychosis Youth Service (EPYS) Program reporting update - 1/5/2023
---


The following advice was communicated by the Department of Health and Aged Care
via e-mail to PHN CEOs on 1 May 2023 in an "Early Psychosis Youth Service (EPYS) Program 
reporting and commissioning update":

EPYS data reporting: 
PHN service providers are not required to report EPYS activity through 
the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS), and this is 
currently not supported. EPYS program data should be collected through 
the headspace Application Platform Interface (hAPI), based on the 
Minimum Data Set specified. The Department will work with headspace 
National to consider how EPYS data in hAPI may be submitted via the 
PMHC MDS in the future and what changes will be required to support 
that. We encourage PHNs to minimise duplicative reporting requirements 
for service providers, and provide feedback to the Department on data 
collection and reporting via [MentalHealthData@health.gov.au](mailto:MentalHealthData@health.gov.au)

#### PMHC MDS Update v2.6.3 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v2.6.3 was released on 
June 1, 2023.

The following updates have been applied in the reporting interface:
* The following new reports have been implemented:
  - I6: Intake Dispatch Status by Intake Organisation
  - I7: Link Status of Episodes Dispatched to Organisation
* The A1 report has been enhanced such that:
  - The ‘Option’ drop down has been renamed to ‘Group By’
  - When ‘National’ is selected as a Reporting Level, a ‘by 
    State/Territory’ option has been added to the ‘Group By’ selector.
  - A ‘State/Territory’ Reporting Level has been added which allows 
    Grouping By ‘None’, ‘PHN’, ‘Practitioner Category’ or ‘Principal 
    Focus of Treatment Plan’
  - A ‘None’ option has been added to the Group By to allow a report 
    that only contains a National/State or Territory/PHN/PO total
  - A ‘Filter By’ selector has been added that allows multiple selections 
    of the entity that was selected for the Group By

The following issues have been fixed:
* Fixed a bug where a pop-up error was being returned after uploading 
  YES-PHN invitations
* Fixed a bug where the episode end date was not being exported in the 
  correct format for YES-PHN invitations
* Fixed a bug where verbose internal errors were being incorrectly passed through
  to the user
* Fixed a bug where the Upload Details tab was not showing warning messages

The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available

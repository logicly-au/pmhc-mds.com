#### PMHC MDS Update v1.4.0 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.4.0 was released on December
7, 2020.

The following new features have been implemented in the data extract tab:

* The Data Extract tab now includes a checkbox to ‘Include data from all
  specifications’. This downloads a file that is a combination of all of
  the extensions listed at
  [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/){:target="_blank"}.
  The resulting file *cannot* be uploaded. This is a download only format.
  It is based on the most recent version used by either the core specification
  or an extension.
* Optimisations have been applied to the data extract query to improve speed.

The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available at:

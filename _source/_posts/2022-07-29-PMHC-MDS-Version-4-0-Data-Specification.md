#### PMHC MDS Version 4.0 Data Specification

The PMHC MDS Version 4.0.0 Data Specification has been published at
[http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/](http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/){:target="_blank"}.

In the week of 1 August 2022, the PMHC MDS data entry interface will be
updated to reflect the Version 4.0 specification and the HeadtoHelp
components of the data entry interface will no longer be available.

At this time the PMHC MDS will accept the following upload formats:
* Version 2
* headspace Version 2 (only to be used by headspace Head Office)
* HeadtoHelp Version 3
* The Way Back Support Service Version 3
* Version 4

The Version 2 and HeadtoHelp Version 3 specifications will continue to be
supported until 31 January 2023. The new Version 4 specification supports
all data currently submittable under Version 2 and HeadtoHelp Version 3.
Therefore, as of 1 February 2023 Version 2 and HeadtoHelp Version 3 will
be retired and the PMHC MDS will no longer support uploads in these formats.

The Way Back Support Service Version 3 specification is in the process of
being upgraded to be based off of the Version 4 specification. Further
announcements will be made regarding retirement of this Version 3 specification.

No changes are currently proposed for headspace Version 2.

#### PMHC MDS outage scheduled for 9:30pm AEDT Thursday 14th March 2019 ####

We will be upgrading the PMHC MDS on Thursday 14th March 2019 between 9:30pm and 11:00pm AEDT.

We expect the outage to last for less than 10 minutes, however the system could be interrupted for up to one hour.

If you are planning on uploading or entering any data during this time, we advise you to complete your work before 9:30pm AEDT.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out. Apologies for the late notice.

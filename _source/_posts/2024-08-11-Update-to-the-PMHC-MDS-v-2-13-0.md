#### PMHC MDS Update v2.13.0 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v2.13.0 was released on August 1, 2024.

As previously advised, Version 2 of the Initial Assessment and Referral Decision Support 
Tool can now be recorded in the PMHC MDS.

Version 2 includes separate rating guides available for use with Children (aged 5-11), 
Adolescents (aged 12-17), Adults (aged 18-64), Older Adults (aged 65 and over). 
More information regarding IAR-DST Version 2 is available via the official IAR-DST
v2 specification documentation at [https://docs.iar-dst.online/en/v2/](https://docs.iar-dst.online/en/v2/){:target="_blank"}.

The PMHC MDS data entry interface will now accept either Version 1 or Version 2 of the IAR-DST.

Both Version 1 and Version 2 of the IAR-DST can now be uploaded to the PMHC MDS using the 
v4.0.4 data specification. v4.0.4 is backwards compatible with the existing v4 
specifications. Therefore, any organisations that are not yet ready to collect IAR-DST 
Version 2 data, can continue to upload with their current file format. The v4.0.4 
data specification is available at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/){:target="_blank"}.

Specific information about implementing Version 2 of the IAR-DST is available at

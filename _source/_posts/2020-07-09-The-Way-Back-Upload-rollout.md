title: PMHC MDS extension - The Way Back - Upload rollout (9/7/2020)
---

#### PMHC MDS extension Way Back upload rollout and training

The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) has been extended to
allow data collection for specific programs. These specifications are only to be
used if your organisation is providing services under the program.

##### The Way Back Support Service

People who have attempted suicide or experienced a suicidal crisis often
experience severe distress in the days and weeks immediately afterwards, and
they are at high risk of attempting again.

Beyond Blue developed The Way Back Support Service to support them through this
critical risk period. A Support Coordinator contacts the person within one
business day of receiving their referral and tailors a program for up to three
months after discharge from hospital. This program is built on personal
connection and integration with community services.

##### The Way Back Support Service Minimum Data Set and Dictionary

The Way Back Support Service Minimum Data Set is an extension of the Primary
Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS), the current Way Back Support
Service Minimum Data Set and Dictionary is available at
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/){:target="_blank"}.

##### STAGE 1 - Submitting The Way Back data via Upload only

Stage 1 has been released in the PMHC MDS for Upload. During the initial stage
of implementing The Way Back records in the PMHC MDS, PHNs and their service
providers will be able to either export data from their client systems and
upload to the PMHC MDS or manually create spreadsheets that can then be uploaded.
Example upload files are available in The Way Back Upload Specification at
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/upload-specification.html](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/upload-specification.html){:target="_blank"}.

**Data may be uploaded in either Excel or CSV format.**

There is a Developers PMHC MDS website available for testing/training purposes
for PHNs, Provider Organisations and third-party developers. See:

##### STAGE 2 - Submitting The Way Back data via Data Entry

The Data Entry Interface will be released in the second stage of development and
will allow users to manually enter The Way Back data through online forms instead
of uploading a spreadsheet or files.

We will announce when this functionality is available.

##### PMHC Helpdesk Training and Support

The PMHC Helpdesk is available to support Developers, Primary Health Networks
and Provider Organisations implementing The Way Back Support Service through
the PMHC MDS.

We can host an online discussion to assist with technical requirements, where to
start or to host an online training session for users of either the Upload
feature, or the Data Entry Interface when available. Contact us to arrange
customised training for your organisationâ€™s needs

      <h4>Let's discuss PMHC MDS.</h4>
      <p class="large">
        The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) is live and ready for you to use in a way that best suits your organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) well underway to understanding how they will manage the PMHC MDS and developing best practice principles around collecting data, it is always a good opportunity to revisit the big picture discussion points. We have
        listed these on
        <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/getstarted/" title="How to get started on the PMHC MDS">Getting Started on the PMHC MDS</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need a bit of inspiration or just want to ensure that you are on the right track with rolling out the PMHC MDS, please feel free to send the PMHC MDS Helpdesk an email on
        <a title="PMHC Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> to organise a time to chat further with us to answer any lingering question you may have. We are here to help make this transition
        as seamless as possible and it is also a great opportunity for us to understand what could be causing obstacles to PHNs.

          Helpdesk's hottest tip.

        <h5>
          Inform new users of the PMHC MDS invitation process
        </h5>
        <p>
          To avoid the invitation email and/or SMS token being deleted, it is always best to notify a user that you will be sending them a PMHC MDS invitation. Inform them that they will receive an invitation by email from noreply@strategicdata.com and a verification
          code via SMS. Please also provide them with the link to the online
          <a title="PMHC MDS User Guide" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/">User Guide</a> to read the steps they will need to complete to

      <h4>What are the hot topics?</h4>
      <p class="large">
        The PMHC MDS Helpdesk has had a few similar enquiries from various PHNs recently, and we thought it would be valuable to share these.
      </p>
      <h5>MHNIPS data collection</h5>
      <p>
        The Department of Health is expecting all commissioned Mental Health Nursing services data from July 2016 to be entered into the PMHC MDS -

      </p>
      <h5>Capturing additional data</h5>
      <p>
        Organisations may collect extra information for their own analysis however this information does not need to be submitted to the PMHC MDS -

      <h5>Fictitious data testing</h5>
      <p>
        The MDS is live and data uploads will be recorded. Real PMHC data can be trialled by
        <a title="Documentation about uploading a file to the PMHC MDS in test mode" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/upload.html#uploading-a-file-in-test-mode">uploading in test mode</a>, whereas fictitious
        data should be trialled with a 'Test Organisation' on developers.pmhc-mds.net -

      </p>
      <h5>Assignment of unique keys</h5>
      <p>
        PHNs have raised a number of queries about the assignment of unique keys.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit Identifier Management under Data Specifications -
          <a title="Information about identifier management" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/identifier-management.html">READ MORE</a>
        </li>
        <li>We have also dedicated a section on the FAQs page -

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Personal mobile phones</h5>
      <p>
        If a user is uneasy with providing their personal mobile phone number, please assure them that this mobile is only used by the PMHC MDS profile management system to deliver the verification code via SMS. This is used to activate their profile, reset their
        password or if a password is forgotten or expires. Users' mobile phone numbers are not listed or able to be viewed by other users within the PMHC MDS -
        <a title="Information about updating your details" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/home.html#updating-your-details">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>Invitation failed error - An outstanding PMHC MDS invite exists</h5>
      <p>
        An invitation will be valid for 7 days and you can not resend an invitation within this time whilst a token is still valid.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If this user didn't receive the email invitation, ask them to double check their junk mail folder and search for an email sent from noreply@strategicdata.com.au. Otherwise they should contact the helpdesk on
          <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If this user didn't receive or deleted the email invitation or the SMS token, ask them to contact the helpdesk on
          <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> as we can reissue it.
        </li>
        <li>If the user has incorrectly entered their token after several attempts, this will cause the previous token to be invalid, then you will no longer receive this message and the invitation will be able to be resent
          again.</li>

        What to expect next?
      </h4>
      <p class="large">
        Let us delve into the developer's world - If you are game then we are too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you have had the opportunity to see the basic PMHC MDS in the December training sessions, I'm sure you are all keen to hear more on what is currently in the development pipeline, and there are a lot of exciting features currently consuming our
        developers' time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The below milestones have been set with new releases to become a regular occurrence. Some features may be a lot of work for a back end developer but will offer minimal visual impact to the current user interface, others will have a significant change
        to the look and will streamline user functionality, or to provide additional and much awaited tools to the website.
      </p>
      <h5>Next Milestone Releases will be:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Limit organisation structure to two levels</li>
        <li>View Client Data</li>
        <li>Online K5 client/practitioner tool</li>
        <li>Basic Summary Reports</li>
        <li>Online K10+ and SDQ client/practitioner tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our long term goal is still focussed on Stage Two release. As the Department has previously announced, it is scheduled for mid 2017 and will feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Comprehensive Reports</li>
        <li>Master Client Index</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are continually trying to improve the user experience, and greatly appreciate your questions, feedback and suggestions, so please don't hesitate to drop us a line or two at <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.

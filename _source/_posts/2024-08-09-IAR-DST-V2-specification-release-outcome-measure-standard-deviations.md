title: PMHC MDS IAR-DST Version 2 and Outcome Measures Standard Deviations - 09/08/2024
---

#### PMHC MDS IAR-DST Version 2 ####

From early next week, Version 2 of the Initial Assessment and Referral 
Decision Support Tool will be able to be recorded in the PMHC MDS.

Version 2 includes separate rating guides available for use with 
Children (aged 5-11), Adolescents (aged 12-17), Adults (aged 18-64), 
Older Adults (aged 65 and over). More information regarding IAR-DST 
Version 2 is available via the official IAR-DST v2 specification 
documentation at [https://docs.iar-dst.online/en/v2/](https://docs.iar-dst.online/en/v2/){:target="_blank"}.

Once upgraded, the PMHC MDS data entry interface will accept either Version 1 or
Version 2 of the IAR-DST.

Both Version 1 and Version 2 of the IAR-DST will be able to be uploaded 
to the PMHC MDS using the v4.0.4 data specification. v4.0.4 is backwards 
compatible with the existing v4 specifications. Therefore, any organisations 
that are not yet ready to collect IAR-DST Version 2 data, can continue to 
upload with their current file format. The v4.0.4 data specification is 
already available at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/){:target="_blank"}.

Specific information about implementing Version 2 of the IAR-DST is available at
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/data-model-and-specifications.html#iar-dst](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/data-model-and-specifications.html#iar-dst){:target="_blank"}.

A further announcement will be made when Version 2 of the IAR-DST is available
in the PMHC MDS.

The v4.0.4 data specification differs from the v4.0.3 data specification in
that the 2.older value for the IAR-DST version field has been updated to
2.older-adult in order to make it consistent with the IAR-DST specification.

#### Outcome Measure Standard Deviations ####

Some reports, such as the Out series reports, use extra inputs that cannot be 
generated locally. Logicly supplies these inputs at 
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/reporting-arrangements.html#inputs-to-help-replicate-system-generated-reports](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/reporting-arrangements.html#inputs-to-help-replicate-system-generated-reports){:target="_blank"}
in order to assist organisations who wish to replicate the system reports.

The outcome measure standard deviations for 2024 are now available at 
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/reporting-arrangements.html#outcome-measure-standard-deviations](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/reporting-arrangements.html#outcome-measure-standard-deviations){:target="_blank"}.

#### PMHC MDS outage scheduled for 9:00pm AEDT Wednesday 9th October 2019 ####

We will be upgrading part of our infrastructure on Wednesday 9th October 2019 between 9:00pm and 11:00pm AEDT.

We expect the outage to last for less than 10 minutes, however the system could be interrupted for up to one hour.

If you are planning on uploading or entering any data during this time, we advise you to complete your work before 9:00pm AEDT.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out.

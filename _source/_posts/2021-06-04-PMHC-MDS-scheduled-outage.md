PMHC MDS outage scheduled for 9pm AEST Thursday 10th June 2021

We will be upgrading part of our infrastructure on Thursday 10th June 2021
between 9:00pm and 10:00pm AEST.

We expect the outage to be brief, however the system could be interrupted
for up to an hour.

If you are planning on uploading or entering any data during this time, we
advise you to complete your work before 9:00pm AEST.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out.

title: Update to the PMHC MDS - 20/9/2020

#### PMHC MDS Update v1.1.0 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.1.0 was released on September 20, 2020.

The following features have been implemented:
* An “Aggregate Reporting” role has been added. The existing “Reporting”
  role gives users access to both the “Reporting” and the “Data Extract” tabs.
  This new role only provides access to the “Reporting” tab. If a user is
  required to see aggregate reports, but not unit record data, they can be
  assigned the “Aggregate Reporting” role without the “Reporting” or
  “Data Entry” roles and they will not have access to unit record data.
  Users have not been assigned the “Aggregate Reporting” role. User Managers
  will need to update users to this new role, if appropriate.
* The “Roles of Assigned Users” table has been redesigned to be more consistent
  with the “View Roles” and “Edit Roles” tables.

The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available at:

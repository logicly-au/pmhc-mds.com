#### PMHC MDS outage scheduled for 9pm AEDT Thursday 27th October 2022 ####

We will be performing ongoing security maintenance of our infrastructure on
Thursday 27th October 2022 between 9:00pm and 10:00pm AEDT.

You may not be able to log-in to Logicly applications at this time. We expect
the outage to be brief, however the system could be interrupted for up to an hour.

Please complete any work involving the PMHC MDS before 9:00pm AEDT to avoid any
impact.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out.

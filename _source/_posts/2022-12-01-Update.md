We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v2.3.6 was released on 
December 1, 2022.

The following updates have been applied:

  Authentication for selected users
* Error messages have been updated to change references to 
  "closed intakes" to "concluded intakes"

The following updates have been applied in the reporting interface:
* Multiple data sources can now be selected for program types within 
  the PMHC data source
* The Wayback data source revised to use all PMHC program types, 
  previously it was a subset of the Flexible Funding Pool
* The A2: Volume Trends report has previously only reported data on a 
  monthly basis. It now has an option to select reporting on either a 
  monthly or weekly basis.
* The I3: IAR-DST by Referral In - Practitioner IAR and I4: IAR-DST 
  by Referral Out - Practitioner IAR have been updated such that:
  - A “No IAR-DST supplied” column has been added
  - The ‘Total episodes’ column has been renamed as ‘Total intakes’
  - The counting of the ‘Total intakes’ column has been changed to 
    count the number of Intakes. It previously counted the number of 
    IAR-DST’s. An Intake can have more than one IAR-DST.
* The following new reports have been implemented:
  - I5: Intake Referral Out by PHN summary
* Fixed a bug where data for the chosen data source(s) were not 
  correctly filtered

#### PMHC MDS Update v2.4.2 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v2.4.2 was released on 
December 16, 2022.

The following updates have been applied:
* The Data Extract tab has been enhanced. Data extracts are now generated in 
  the background. Users can continue with other MDS tasks while they are 
  generated. Data extracts are retained for 7 days and can be accessed via 
  the new ‘View extracts’ sub tab.
* The G1: Residential Aged Care Facility Client Outcomes report has been 
  optimised to run faster.
* Selecting Regional Reporting Level and a particular PHN in the I5 now gives 
  a row for each PO in the table rather than a single summary for the entire 
  PHN.
* The SDQ data entry interface now excludes the "8: Not applicable (collection 
  not required - item not included in the version collected, or SDQ Item 26 
  = 0)" option where it is not applicable.

The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available
at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/){:target="_blank"}.

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v2.5.3 was released on 
February 16, 2023.

The following updates have been applied:
* Episodes tagged with the ‘!covid19’ tag were being rejected. 
  This has been fixed.

##### Reminder #####

HeadtoHealth Episodes entered/uploaded in Version 4 no longer require 
the ‘!covid19’ tag.

The !covid19 tag has now reverted to its original use to flag that an 
episode has occurred  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more

#### PMHC MDS file upload outage scheduled for 9pm AEDT Monday 12th October 2020 ####

We will be upgrading part of our infrastructure on Monday 12th October 2020 between 9:00pm and 9:30pm AEDT.

We expect the outage to be brief, however the system could be interrupted for up to half an hour.

If you are planning on uploading or entering any data during this time, we advise you to complete your work before 9:00pm AEDT.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out. Apologies for the late notice.

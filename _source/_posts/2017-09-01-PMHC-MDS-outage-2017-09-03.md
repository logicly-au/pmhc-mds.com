#### PMHC MDS outage on Sunday 3 September 2017

In addition to our regular system maintenance which occurs fortnightly on Wednesdays in the period 9:00pm-12:00pm AEST, we will be upgrading the database systems on Sunday at 8:00pm AEST.

As such, the PMHC MDS will be unavailable sometime in the period 8:00pm - 10:00pm AEST on Sunday 3 September, 2017.

If you are planning on using any of the data products during this time, we advise you to complete your work before 8:00pm AEST.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this maintenance is carried out.

#### Online Measures Self Service System ####

The Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS) is a service funded by the
Australian Government Department of Health as part of the Primary Mental
Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS). It allows clients of mental health
services commissioned by Primary Health Networks (PHNs) to complete the
standardised outcome measures mandated in the PMHC MDS and have the results
reported back to their service providers.

The K10+, K5 and SDQ are now available through the OMSSS.

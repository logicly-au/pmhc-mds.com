title: Reminder of the End of Life for PMHC MDS version 4.0 Data Specification
---

The PMHC MDS currently supports uploads in both the PMHC version 4.0 format as
documented at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/){:target="_blank"}
and the PMHC version 4.1 format as documented at
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/){:target="_blank"}.

After the 1st of May 2025 the PMHC MDS will no longer accept uploads using the
Version 4.0 formats. Please ensure that your systems have been migrated to
using the Version 4.1 upload format before this date.

A summary of the changes between version 4.0 and 4.1 is available at
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/upgrading-from-previous-versions.html](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/upgrading-from-previous-versions.html){:target="_blank"}.

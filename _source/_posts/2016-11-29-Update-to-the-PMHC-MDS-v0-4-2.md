title: Update to the PMHC MDS - 29/11/2016
---

PMHC MDS Update v0.4.2 was released on November 29, 2016.

The ‘User Management’ role has been split with a new role ‘Organisation Management’ being created. Primary Contact users have had the ‘Organisation Management’ role added to their account.

The ‘User Management’ role now only allows a user to invite new users to use the PMHC MDS and also manage the roles that the user has. It no longer allows you to manage provider organisations.

The ‘Organisation Management’ role allows a user to add and manage provider organisations.

The Primary Contact user will need to provide any other users at their organisations with the ‘Organisation Management’ role if appropriate.

The user guide has been updated to reflect these roles, available at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/)

#### PMHC MDS Update v1.14.1 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.14.1 was released on
November 26, 2021.

The following functionality has been implemented in the data entry and
upload interfaces:

* The `!amhc` reserved tag can now be applied to episode records.

The following functionality has been implemented in the user management
interface:

* An ‘Actions’ column has been added to the ‘Edit Roles’ tab. This allows
  removal of all of a user’s roles at an organisation. This action will
  also disable future password reminder prompts when the user doesn’t have
  roles at another organisation.
* A user who has all their roles removed after this release, will no longer
  be able to login.

The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available
at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/){:target="_blank"}.

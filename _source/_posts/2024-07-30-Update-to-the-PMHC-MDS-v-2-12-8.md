title: Clarification and Update to the PMHC MDS - 30/7/2024 (v2.12.8)
---

You may have seen a recent PMHC MDS notification that users from State 
and Territory Governments will now be given access to aggregate PMHC MDS 
reports. We wish to advise that this only means that the technical data 
systems of the PMHC MDS have been updated in order to allow for access to be 
granted. Sharing of the PMHC MDS with State and Territory Governments as per 
commitments under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement 
is being closely managed by the Department of Health and Aged Care and access 
will only be granted after the relevant State or Territory health 
department/agency has signed a Data Sharing Agreement and agreed to follow a 
Data Access Protocol. These documents describe roles and responsibilities for 
specific users within a State or Territory health department/agency to ensure 
PMHC MDS data is handled appropriately and safely. Further information will 
be provided by the Department in due course.

#### PMHC MDS Update v0.28.7 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v0.28.7 was released on April 8, 2019.

The following bugfixes have been implemented in the reporting interface:
* The Key Performance Indicator report ‘App-1 - Youth receiving youth specific services' has been updated to only include episodes where the Principal Focus of Treatment Plan is ‘Child and youth-specific mental health services’.
* The Key Performance Indicator report ‘App-1 - Youth receiving youth specific services' has been updated as it was missing a row for "Not stated/inadequately described" and incorrectly calculated the "TOTAL" row when disaggregated by ATSI status.

The user guide has been updated to reflect these updates. It is available at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/){:target="_blank"}.

title: PMHC MDS system and network upgrades on Saturday 9 December 2017 - 29/11/2017
---

On 22 November 2017 we sent out an announcement that there would be a PMHC MDS system and network upgrade on Saturday 2 December between 10:00am and 2:00pm AEDT.

Unfortunately this upgrade has been delayed. We will now be performing system and network upgrades on Saturday 9 December between 10:00am and 2:00pm AEDT.

We do not expect any outage, but there is the possibility that an outage may
occur during this period.

If you are planning on uploading or entering any data during this time, we
advise you to complete your work before 10:00am AEDT.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out.

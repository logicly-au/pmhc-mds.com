#### PMHC MDS Update v1.11.0 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v1.11.0 was released on June 14, 2021.

The following change has been implemented in the reports interface:
* Updated the W1: Wayback quarterly report template.
  * Added links from the template to the user documentation
  * Changed the `Client Measures and Experience` section to report the Number
    of Initial, Review and Exit Measures completed during the period instead
    of the number of pairs of matched outcome measures.
  * Added `Number of On-Time Events` and `Number of Events` into the
    `Key Performance Indicators` section. These are the numerator and
    denominator used to calculate the `% Achieved During Reporting Period`.
    These have been added to assist organisations who are attempting to
    reproduce the KPI results.

  This new template also includes a table for the manual reporting of the
  ‘Consent to participate in TWBSS’ data, you *do not* need to report this
  for the Q4 April-June 2021 submission.

The following bugfix has been implemented in the data entry interface:
* Updated the guide descriptions when viewing a WHO-5.

title: PMHC MDS - Domain name change - whitelisting required
---

Dear All,

As part of our transition to Logicly we're updating our systems to be
accessible under the logicly.com.au and logicly.au domains, rather than
strategicdata.com.au.

The strategicdata.com.au domain will cease to be active on 31st May 2022.

If your organisation is whitelisting our domains to permit access to our
applications please contact your IT department to request that they add the
logicly.com.au and logicly.au domains. This is important to ensure your
uninterrupted access. Note that we have no way of knowing if this is the case.
If you are unsure, your IT department can assist.

While the strategicdata.com.au domain will remain registered and under our
control for the foreseeable future we will no longer be exposing any
application related content on that domain once our transition to the logicly
domains is complete.

Kind regards,
The Logicly team

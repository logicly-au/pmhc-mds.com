#### PMHC MDS Upcoming Updates ####

##### Login changes #####

The PMHC MDS is in the process of being upgraded to support Multi Factor
Authentication (MFA). In preparation for MFA the PMHC MDS login screen will
shortly change. It will be Logicly branded and served from the domain
login.logicly.com.au.

This is an example screenshot of the new login screen:

##### Monthly user audit reminder notification #####

In order to ensure that users who no longer require access to the PMHC MDS have had their access removed, users with the User Management role should periodically review all PMHC users for their organisation. Removing users who no longer require access improves the safety of your data by preventing unauthorised updates.

To prompt this process, we are pleased to announce that a monthly ‘PMHC-MDS User Audit Reminder Notification’ email will be sent to users with the User Management role.

The email will request that you review your PMHC MDS users and remove any users who no longer require access.

For PMHC MDS Production users, the email will be sent on the first Monday of each month and request that users go to [https://pmhc-mds.net/#/tools/user-audit](https://pmhc-mds.net/#/tools/user-audit){:target="_blank"}.

For PMHC MDS Developers users, the email will be sent on the fourth Monday of each month and request that users go to [https://developers.pmhc-mds.net/#/tools/user-audit](https://developers.pmhc-mds.net/#/tools/user-audit){:target="_blank"}.

The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available
at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/){:target="_blank"}.

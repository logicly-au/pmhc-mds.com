#### PMHC MDS outage scheduled for 7am Saturday 6th October 2018 ####

We will be upgrading part of our infrastructure on Saturday 6th October 2018 between 7:00am and 8:00am AEST.

We expect the outage to last for less than 10 minutes, however the system could be interrupted for up to one hour.

If you are planning on uploading or entering any data during this time, we advise you to complete your work before 7:00am AEST.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out. Apologies for the late notice.

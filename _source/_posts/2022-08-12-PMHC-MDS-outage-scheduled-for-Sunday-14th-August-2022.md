#### PMHC MDS outage scheduled for Sunday 14th August 2022

We will be migrating data for the Version 4 release on the evening of
Sunday 14th August 2022. The PMHC MDS may be unavailable for several hours
during this period.

If you are planning on uploading or entering any data this weekend, we advise
you to complete your work on Saturday.

Thank-you for your patience whilst this work is carried out.

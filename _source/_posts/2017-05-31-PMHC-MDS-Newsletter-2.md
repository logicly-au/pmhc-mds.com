        Let's discuss PMHC MDS.
      </h4>
      <p>
        We are fast approaching the end of the financial year.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) now focused on new and existing contracts with Provider Organisations (PO) we want to further clarify the timelines and requirements for the PMHC MDS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Department is aware that 2016-17 is a transitional year however 2017-18 is expected to have comprehensive mental health services data collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upload functionality has been available on the PMHC MDS since November 2016. All PHNs are expected to start uploading their data in preparation for 1 July 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next few weeks, data entry will start to be rolled out in a staged process. Data entry will be available in the following order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practitioners</li>
        <li>Clients</li>
        <li>Episodes</li>
        <li>Service Contacts</li>
        <li>K10+</li>
        <li>K5</li>
        <li>SDQ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Strategic Data have been working on the transitional development of an ATAPS data extract that will allow active ATAPS data to be exported to the PMHC MDS. More news on this process will be released soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you aren't sure what your PHN should be doing to be prepared for 1 July, please contact
        <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>
        and we'll organise a time to discuss options that would best suit your circumstances.

              The PMHC MDS Service Provider Quick Reference Guide has been added to the PMHC MDS website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The PMHC MDS Service Provider QUICK REFERENCE Guide is a resource intended to describe key issues and concepts related to the collection of, and provision of data to, the PMHC MDS for mental health service providers.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two versions of the PMHC MDS Service Provider Quick Reference Guide. If you are a service provider, it is recommended that you use the <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide-20170516.pdf">PDF version</a> produced by the Department of Health. If you are a Primary Health Network, you can use the <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/doc/service-provider-quick-reference-guide-template-20170516.docx">word version</a> to tailor some of the information to your local context.
            </p>
            <p>
              This guide has been added to the resources available on <a title="PMHC MDS Resources" href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/resources/">pmhc-mds.com</a>

      <h4>
        What are the hot topics?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The PMHC MDS Helpdesk has had a few similar enquiries from various PHNs recently, and we thought it would be valuable to share these.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Specification Definitions
			</h5>
      <p>
        Each data item has associated notes that provide guidance on which response to use. By clicking on the <a title="PMHC MDS Data Record FormatsSpecification " href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#record-formats">Record Formats</a> field name this will take you to the field definition which outlines the associated notes.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Client Consent
			</h5>
      <p>
        All data can be uploaded to the PMHC MDS, regardless of the consent flag.  We have added more details to the Client consent information to explain how this data will be managed by the PMHC MDS -
        <a title="Definition of 'Episode - Client Consent to Anonymised Data'" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#episode-client-consent-to-anonymised-data">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        First Uploads
			</h5>
      <p>
        Now is the right time for PHNs and Provider Organisations to be testing uploads. Start small and test how the system responds to ensure that you have the base file format fundamentals for the uploads file/worksheet. Once the initial small uploads are successful, you'll find it much easier to roll out the system from there. For Upload Specification information -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Upload File Format Specification" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/upload-specification.html#">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        PHNs can request a 'Test' Organisation
			</h5>
      <p>
        If PHNs would like to set up a test organisation for initial upload tests with fictitious/test data, then PHNs can request one to be created on the separate Developers PMHC MDS.  Just follow the instructions as outlined for software developers -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Annoucement for Developers site" href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2017/02/17/Separate-PMHC-MDS-now-available-for-software-developers-to-test-upload-files/">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        Client Key
			</h5>
      <p>
        We understand that PHNs are having difficulty with the requirement for there to be a stable and unique client key across their provider organisations. This is the problem that the Master Client Index (MCI) is being designed to help with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strategic Data have analysed the feedback from the one on one discussions with the volunteer PHNs, and passed this feedback onto The Department of Health. Options are currently being discussed. Once a decision has been reached it will be communicated to all PHNs.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Reporting timelines
			</h5>
      <p>
        The PMHC MDS won't remind users to upload data. PHNs will receive reporting dates from the Department. PHNs will need to manage within their own systems and remind Provider Organisations to upload if required.  We have listed a minimum expectation for upload timelines on the PMHC documentation site -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Reporting timelines" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/reporting-arrangements.html#reporting-timeliness">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        ATAPS news list communication
			</h5>
      <p>
        The ATAPS mailing list will no longer receive messages from the evaluation team at The University of Melbourne reminding them to upload data. This has caused some recent confusion for current Provider Organisations who are reporting data to the old ATAPS MDS. It is the responsibility of PHNs to manage the data that is entered into the ATAPS MDS.

        Milestone Releases
      </h5>
      <p>
        From recent Helpdesk PHN enquiries and discussions, Strategic Data has been able to advocate that for PHNs the Data Entry interface is more important to them than the Outcome Measures Self Service Interface. The Department has approved this development priority change and Strategic Data resources have been moved accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get Data Entry functionality to PHNs as soon as possible, development of this feature has been split into several components.  The first of these, Viewing Client Data, was released in <a title="PMHC MDS v0.9.2 News Annoucement" href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2017/05/18/Update-to-the-PMHC-MDS-v0-9-2-and-Data-Specifications-v1-0-6/">v0.9.2</a>.  As mentioned above, the remaining features will be rolled out iteratively over the coming weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next Milestone Releases will be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practitioners Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Client Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Episode Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Service Contacts Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>K5 and K10+ Outcome Measures Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>SDQ Outcome Measures Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Online K5 and K10+ Outcome Measures Self-Service Interface</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reporting is still in the early stages of development. Initial reports will be designed to assist data managers monitor the data that has been uploaded/entered into the PMHC MDS.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Stage Two
      </h5>
      <p>
        Once data entry has been implemented we will continue to focus on the remaining <a title="PMHC MDS Stage Two Development" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/development.html#development-of-the-pmhc-minimum-data-set">Stage Two</a> developments. Releases for these items will continue throughout this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once more information is available, we will circulate more specific timelines. Please regularly check the announcements on the <a title="PMHC MDS Home Page" href="https://pmhc-mds.com/#/">PMHC MDS home page</a> to keep informed.

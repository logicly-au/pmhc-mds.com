#### PMHC MDS Update v0.37.2 ####

We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v0.37.2 was released on June 1, 2020.

The following features have been implemented in the user management interface:
* Filtering has been enabled on the Invites table

The following features have been implemented in the data entry interface:
* The Service Contact add and edit forms have been rearranged so that ‘No Show’ is after ‘Service Contact Date’. The following fields are now pre-filled based on the value of ‘No Show’:
  * Service Contact - Type
  * Service Contact - Postcode
  * Service Contact - Modality
  * Service Contact - Venue
  * Service Contact - Duration

The following features have been implemented in the upload interface:
* PHN users can now see all uploads for their PHN
* Data entered, but not saved before a timeout is now saved so that the data can be restored if the user logs back in within 15 minutes

The following bug fixes have been implemented in the reports interface:
* Corrected the B6 Option from ‘Primary focus of treatment plan’ to ‘Principal focus of treatment plan’
* Fixed a bug where the ‘Request’ button was inactive and no error messages where shown when there was no active organisation with the reporting period

The user guide has been updated to reflect these updates. It is available

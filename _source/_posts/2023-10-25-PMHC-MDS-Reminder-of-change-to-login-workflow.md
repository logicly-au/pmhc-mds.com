#### PMHC-MDS - Change to login workflow {#reminder-pmhc-mds---change-to-login-workflow}

As part of Logicly’s ongoing commitment to data security and in response to the Australian Signals Directorate’s Information Security Manual guidance, we are introducing a new authentication process for accessing the PMHC-MDS.

##### What is changing? {#reminder-what-is-changing}

The immediate change for users will be a requirement to use your full email address as your username when logging in to the application. Once you’ve entered your full email address on the first screen you’ll be asked to enter your password on a second screen, and then you will access the application as normal. See examples below.

<div style="text-align: center;background:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;margin:0px auto;max-width:600px;">
  <div>                 
     <div><p>First screen</p></div>    
     <div><img alt="A screenshot of the new first login screen showing the Logicly logo, the words 'Welcome. Log in to Logicly to continue' followed by a text field that requires an email address and then a 'Continue' button." src="https://www.logicly.com.au/email/auth0-login-workflow/step-1.png"  width="250"></div>
  </div>
  <div>           
    <div><p>Second screen</p></div>    
    <div><img alt="A screenshot of the new second login screen showing the Logicly logo, the words 'Enter Your Password. Enter you password for Logicly to continue.' followed by an inactive text field that shows the email address entered in the first screen and an Edit link, then another text field that requires a password and then a 'Continue' button." src="https://www.logicly.com.au/email/auth0-login-workflow/step-2.png" width="250"></div>
  </div>
</div>

##### When will this happen? {#reminder-when-will-this-happen}

Logicly intends to release this change in October. A reminder email will be sent in the days prior to the change.

##### Why is this happening? {#reminder-why-is-this-happening}

The change is being made in order to enable or enhance multi-factor authentication (MFA) within the application and to facilitate future security improvements around the authentication and authorisation process.

Also, by capturing the email addresses in the first step, the login process can be tailored to different organisation’s requirements in the future. For example, login could be handled using the same details as you use to login to your organisation’s systems. This is known as Single Sign On or SSO.

Note that MFA will be rolled out progressively in the near future on a schedule yet to be agreed. You will be informed well prior to MFA being required with a timeline and supporting documentation.

Please email [support@pmhc-mds.com](mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com) if you have any questions or issues.

Thank you

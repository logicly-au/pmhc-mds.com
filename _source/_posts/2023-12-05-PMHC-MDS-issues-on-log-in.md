#### PMHC MDS - ‘Error 500’ issues on log-in ####

Dear PMHC MDS user,

We’ve been made aware that users are intermittently receiving an error message 
saying ‘Error 500 - Internal Server Error’ when logging-in to the PMHC MDS. 

Unfortunately in some cases it takes multiple attempts to log-in, but please 
try refreshing your browser window first as that often works.

We are very sorry for the inconvenience this causes. Our senior developers are 
investigating the issue and we will deploy a fix as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience, 
Logicly

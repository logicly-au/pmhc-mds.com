#### PMHC MDS IAR-DST Version 2 ####

Version 2 of the Initial Assessment and Referral Decision Support Tool has now
been finalised and will soon be able to be collected in the PMHC MDS.

Version 2 includes separate rating guides available for use with Children (aged 5-11),
Adolescents (aged 12-17), Adults (aged 18-64), Older Adults (aged 65 and over).
More information regarding IAR-DST Version 2 is available via the official IAR-DST v2
specification documentation at [https://docs.iar-dst.online/en/v2/](https://docs.iar-dst.online/en/v2/){:target="_blank"}.

Once upgraded, the PMHC MDS data entry interface will accept either Version 1 or
Version 2 of the IAR-DST.

Both Version 1 and Version 2 of the IAR-DST will be able to be uploaded to the
PMHC MDS using the v4.0.3 data specification. v4.0.3 is backwards compatible with
the existing v4 specifications. Therefore, any organisations that are not yet
ready to collect IAR-DST Version 2 data, can continue to upload with their current
file format. The v4.0.3 data specification is already available at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.0.3/](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.0.3/){:target="_blank"}.

Specific information about implementing Version 2 of the IAR-DST is available at
[https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.0.3/data-model-and-specifications.html#iar-dst](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.0.3/data-model-and-specifications.html#iar-dst){:target="_blank"}.

A further announcement will be made when Version 2 of the IAR-DST is available
in the PMHC MDS.

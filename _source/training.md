## <a id="user_guide"></a>Online User Guide

The [Online User Guide](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/index.html)
is regularly updated to reflect each update release and outlines
step by step instructions for each role within the PMHC MDS.

## <a id="group_training"></a>Online group training

Online group training sessions are currently hosted by the PMHC Helpdesk between 10am - 6pm AEST/AEDT.

Access to the PMHC MDS is based around roles, and therefore online group
training sessions have been designed for a role. The following provides a
summary of each of the roles that we currently provide training for:

*Unsure which role you have? More information can be found at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/users.html#users-roles](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/users.html#users-roles).*

Online training sessions are held through an online GoToMeeting session by request. Each
session will be limited to approx. 25 users and can have a combination of staff from one
Provider Organisation, or various Provider Organisation users from around Australia.

To book in for an online training session please email [support@pmhc-mds.com](mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com)
with your preferred training session role type and date/time. A GoToMeeting link will be sent to
you via a calendar invitation.

Please note: Users who do not yet have an active login to the PMHC MDS can
still attend our training sessions. It would be very beneficial to organise
access prior to the training session, as this will then enable users to login
and commence using the PMHC MDS straight after the training session concludes.
*(More information on obtaining a login can be viewed in Step 4 above, or on
the PMHC MDS FAQS which can be found at [https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/access.html](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/access.html))*

Funding by the Australian Government Department of Health has been provided to
Primary Health Networks (PHNs) through a Primary Mental Health Care flexible
funding pool to support commissioning of mental health and suicide prevention
services in six key service delivery areas:

* low intensity psychological interventions for people with, or at risk of,
  mild mental illness;
* psychological therapies delivered by mental health professionals to under
  serviced groups;
* early intervention services for children and young people with, or at risk of
  mental illness;
* services for people with severe and complex mental illness who are being
  managed in a primary care setting;
* enhanced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health services; and
* a regional approach to suicide prevention activities with a focus on improved
  follow-up for people who have attempted suicide or are at high risk of suicide.

The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will provide the
basis for PHNs and the Department of Health to monitor and report on the quantity and quality of service delivery, and to inform future improvements in the planning and funding of primary mental health care services funded by the Australian Government.

The data reported by PHNs through the PMHC MDS will form the basis for
production of key performance indicators used to monitor services delivered
across the 31 PHN regions covered by PHNs.

Funding by the Australian Government Department of Health has been provided to
Primary Health Networks (PHNs) through a Primary Mental Health Care flexible
funding pool to support commissioning of mental health and suicide prevention
services in six key service delivery areas:
          
* low intensity psychological interventions for people with, or at risk of,
  mild mental illness;
* psychological therapies delivered by mental health professionals to under
  serviced groups;
* early intervention services for children and young people with, or at risk of
  mental illness;
* services for people with severe and complex mental illness who are being
  managed in a primary care setting; enhanced Aboriginal and Torres Strait
  Islander mental health services; and a regional approach to suicide
  prevention activities with a focus on improved follow-up for people who have
  attempted suicide or are at high risk of suicide.

The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will provide the
basis for monitoring and evaluation of these services.

The data reported by PHNs through the PMHC MDS will form the basis for
production of key performance indicators used to monitor services delivered
across the 31 PHN regions covered by PHNs.

A draft specification of the data items to be collected in the PMHC MDS is
available. If you would like to be notified of updates to this specification or

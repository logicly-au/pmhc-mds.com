    <h4>March 29, 2017</h4>
	<p>Stage 2 development of the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS)  is currently underway. A requirement of the PMHC MDS is that a client key must be unique within each Primary Health Network (PHN) independent of the treating organisation. It is the responsibility of PHNs and Provider Organisations to co-ordinate to maintain this identifier. Clients should not be assigned multiple keys within the same PHN.</p>

<p>In order to help maintain the client key, a component of Stage 2 is to develop a Master Client Index (MCI). It is envisaged that Provider Organisations will be able to access the MCI in order to locate existing clients at other Provider Organisations with the same PHN and match the client key, or create a new client if the client does not yet exist in the MCI.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the MCI meets the needs of PHNs and Provider Organisations we would like to discuss the requirements with a volunteer group of PHNs and their Provider Organisations. These discussions would take the form of teleconferences and possibly one on one phone calls.</p>

<p>Organisations who are willing to volunteer are requested to email <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 7 April 2017.</p>

        The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) is live and ready for you to use in a way that best suits your organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) well underway to understanding how they will manage the PMHC MDS and developing best practice principles around collecting data, it is always a good opportunity to revisit the big picture discussion points. We have
        listed these on
        <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/getstarted/" title="How to get started on the PMHC MDS">Getting Started on the PMHC MDS</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need a bit of inspiration or just want to ensure that you are on the right track with rolling out the PMHC MDS, please feel free to send the PMHC MDS Helpdesk an email on
        <a title="PMHC Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> to organise a time to chat further with us to answer any lingering question you may have. We are here to help make this transition
        as seamless as possible and it is also a great opportunity for us to understand what could be causing obstacles to PHNs.

          Inform new users of the PMHC MDS invitation process
        </h5>
        <p>
          To avoid the invitation email and/or SMS token being deleted, it is always best to notify a user that you will be sending them a PMHC MDS invitation. Inform them that they will receive an invitation by email from noreply@strategicdata.com and a verification
          code via SMS. Please also provide them with the link to the online
          <a title="PMHC MDS User Guide" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/">User Guide</a> to read the steps they will need to complete to

      <h5>Assignment of unique keys</h5>
      <p>
        PHNs have raised a number of queries about the assignment of unique keys.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit Identifier Management under Data Specifications -
          <a title="Information about identifier management" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/identifier-management.html">READ MORE</a>

      </ul>
      <h5>Personal mobile phones</h5>
      <p>
        If a user is uneasy with providing their personal mobile phone number, please assure them that this mobile is only used by the PMHC MDS profile management system to deliver the verification code via SMS. This is used to activate their profile, reset their
        password or if a password is forgotten or expires. Users' mobile phone numbers are not listed or able to be viewed by other users within the PMHC MDS -

      </p>
      <h5>Invitation failed error - An outstanding PMHC MDS invite exists</h5>
      <p>
        An invitation will be valid for 7 days and you can not resend an invitation within this time whilst a token is still valid.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If this user didn't receive the email invitation, ask them to double check their junk mail folder and search for an email sent from noreply@strategicdata.com.au. Otherwise they should contact the helpdesk on
          <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If this user didn't receive or deleted the email invitation or the SMS token, ask them to contact the helpdesk on
          <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> as we can reissue it.
        </li>
        <li>If the user has incorrectly entered their token after several attempts, this will cause the previous token to be invalid, then you will no longer receive this message and the invitation will be able to be resent
          again.</li>

        What to expect next?
      </h4>
      <p class="large">
        Let us delve into the developer's world - If you are game then we are too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you have had the opportunity to see the basic PMHC MDS in the December training sessions, I'm sure you are all keen to hear more on what is currently in the development pipeline, and there are a lot of exciting features currently consuming our
        developers' time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The below milestones have been set with new releases to become a regular occurrence. Some features may be a lot of work for a back end developer but will offer minimal visual impact to the current user interface, others will have a significant change
        to the look and will streamline user functionality, or to provide additional and much awaited tools to the website.
      </p>
      <h5>Next Milestone Releases will be:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Limit organisation structure to two levels</li>
        <li>View Client Data</li>
        <li>Online K5 client/practitioner tool</li>
        <li>Basic Summary Reports</li>
        <li>Online K10+ and SDQ client/practitioner tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our long term goal is still focussed on Stage Two release. As the Department has previously announced, it is scheduled for mid 2017 and will feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Comprehensive Reports</li>
        <li>Master Client Index</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are continually trying to improve the user experience, and greatly appreciate your questions, feedback and suggestions, so please don't hesitate to drop us a line or two at <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.

    <h4>October 14, 2016</h4>
	<p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs on Friday 14 October 2016.</p>

<p>-----------------------</p>

<p>Dear PHN CEOs</p>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will be available for all Primary Health Networks (PHNs) to commence uploading data in early December. Prior to this we are looking for between 5 and 10 PHNs to volunteer as early adopters. These PHNs will commence upload from the 7th of November, and help us to streamline the system prior to making it available to all PHNs from the beginning of December.</p>

<p>We would like some of the early adopters to be uploading zipped csv files and some to be uploading Excel spreadsheets. They will need to be willing to provide feedback on the process used to give the primary contact user access to the system, the usability of the system, and the documentation and training.</p>

<p>Benefits of moving to the PMHC include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early access to features which are not included in the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS:</li>
<li>Partitioning of provider organisations within a PHN so that provider organisations can only access their own data.</li>
<li>Delegation of user management to each provider organisation.</li>
<li>Reduced data collection burden due to not needing to collect data items that have been retired from the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com?Subject=PMHC%20MDS%20Request%20for%20early%20adopters" target="_top">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by Friday the 28th of October, 2016 if you would like to volunteer. PHNs who have been selected to be early adopters will be notified on Wednesday the 2nd of November, 2016.</p>

<p>Additionally there are still a few PHNs who have not yet submitted a 'Letter of Authority' it would be appreciated if you could address this as a matter of priority. If you are unsure we will be following up with individual PHN's in the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

		"title"    : "INFORMATION and ACTION&#58; PHN CEO - Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set Update",
		"date"     : "June 21, 2017",
		"content"  : "<p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs on Tuesday 20 June 2017.</p>

<p>-----------------------</p>

<p>Dear PHN CEOs,</p>

<p>From 1 July 2017, PHNs are expected to be uploading data into the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS). The following provides CEOs an update on the transition to full compliance and the master client index.</p>

<p><b>Transition to Full Compliance</b></p>

<p>Previous communications have indicated that the existing Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) / Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) MDS would be shut down when the PMHC MDS data entry interface was implemented. Due to difficulties in converting the data between the two systems, the ATAPS/MHSRA system will continue until further notice.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2017, full compliance with the PMHC MDS is still expected. However, this means all consenting clients referred for mental health services from 1 July 2017 have information entered into the PMHC MDS. Existing clients whose data has been entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS may continue to do so. However, new referrals should NOT be entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS from 1 July 2017.</p>

<p>Options for reporting and transferring active ATAPS referrals into the new PMHC MDS have been considered by the PMHC MDS Working Group and three options have been agreed for addressing the needs. Each PHN must choose only one option, their preferred option, of the three presented below.</p>

<p>Once selected, please have your PMHC MDS Data Primary User advise your preferred option to Strategic Data at <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 1 July 2017. Strategic Data will then work with the PHN on their preferred option.</p>

<p><i>Option one</i></p>
<p>The ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS will be kept online for up to 12 months to allow for those existing client referrals already receiving services under the old ‘ATAPS’ system to be maintained until all sessions associated with that referral are complete.</p>

<p>This option requires PHNs and their organisations to work with two data collections, ie: The PMHC MDS for new clients / episodes commencing post 1 July 2017 and the old ATAPS system for existing clients who have not completed their treatment.</p>

<p><i>Option two</i></p>
<p>Strategic Data will provide the PHN an <i>ATAPS MDS data extract in PMHC MDS upload format</i>. The extract will contain ATAPS clients and their associated data where a client had an associated session in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Note that, ATAPS does not associate clients with provider organisations, which is a structural element required for the PMHC MDS. Therefore, the organisation path in this extract will be empty and the PHN will need to assign each client to their correct provider organisation. Any other data which cannot be mapped from ATAPS to PMHC data definitions will be set as missing. Each record will have the ‘!ATAPS’ tag added so records exported from ATAPS can be identified in future analysis.</p>

<p>This option will require significant work by the PHN to assign provider organisations to each client and significant amounts of missing data on the migrated clients.</p>

<p><i>Option three</i></p>
<p>Where PHNs are implementing new clients systems, they may choose to map the ATAPS data to PMHC data and then upload to the PMHC MDS directly from their client system. PHNs choosing this option will be provided with specifications of the <i>mapping of ATAPS to PMHC format</i> being used to produce the ATAPS MDS data extract at option two. This option requires PHNs to follow this mapping format to provide consistency in mapped ATAPS data.</p>

<p><b>Master Client Index</b></p>

<p>The current PMHC MDS specification requires a Client Key that is unique and stable at the PHN regional level, not at the provider organisation level. The purpose of the Master Client Index is to help PHNs and their provider organisations manage client information across the PHN region. This requirement has proven problematic for PHNs and is being worked through by the PMHC MDS Working Group.</p>

<p>To determine what issues exist with managing the client key and possible solutions, nine PHNs worked with Strategic Data to describe their models for triaging patients, the information systems being used by PHNs and provider organisations, the ease of updating information systems and resources available for manual reconciliation of clients.</p>

<p>As a result of this work, a Master Client Index is not possible at this time, and as such, will not be a requirement for full compliance from 1 July 2017. The requirement will now be organisational uniqueness instead of regional level uniqueness until this can be addressed.</p>

<p>The PMHC Working Group agrees that the opportunity for national and regional level uniqueness is an aspiration and will continue to be investigated by the Department. The Department is currently looking into the use of Healthcare Identifiers and will provide you with updates as this work progresses.</p>

<p>If you have any further queries, please email: <a href="mailto:mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au">mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

      <p>
        We are fast approaching the end of the financial year.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) now focused on new and existing contracts with Provider Organisations (PO) we want to further clarify the timelines and requirements for the PMHC MDS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Department is aware that 2016-17 is a transitional year however 2017-18 is expected to have comprehensive mental health services data collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upload functionality has been available on the PMHC MDS since November 2016. All PHNs are expected to start uploading their data in preparation for 1 July 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next few weeks, data entry will start to be rolled out in a staged process. Data entry will be available in the following order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practitioners</li>
        <li>Clients</li>
        <li>Episodes</li>

        <li>SDQ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Strategic Data have been working on the transitional development of an ATAPS data extract that will allow active ATAPS data to be exported to the PMHC MDS. More news on this process will be released soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you aren't sure what your PHN should be doing to be prepared for 1 July, please contact

        The PMHC MDS Helpdesk has had a few similar enquiries from various PHNs recently, and we thought it would be valuable to share these.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Specification Definitions
			</h5>
      <p>
        Each data item has associated notes that provide guidance on which response to use. By clicking on the <a title="PMHC MDS Data Record FormatsSpecification " href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#record-formats">Record Formats</a> field name this will take you to the field definition which outlines the associated notes.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Client Consent
			</h5>
      <p>
        All data can be uploaded to the PMHC MDS, regardless of the consent flag.  We have added more details to the Client consent information to explain how this data will be managed by the PMHC MDS -
        <a title="Definition of 'Episode - Client Consent to Anonymised Data'" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#episode-client-consent-to-anonymised-data">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        First Uploads
			</h5>
      <p>
        Now is the right time for PHNs and Provider Organisations to be testing uploads. Start small and test how the system responds to ensure that you have the base file format fundamentals for the uploads file/worksheet. Once the initial small uploads are successful, you'll find it much easier to roll out the system from there. For Upload Specification information -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Upload File Format Specification" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/upload-specification.html#">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        PHNs can request a 'Test' Organisation
			</h5>
      <p>
        If PHNs would like to set up a test organisation for initial upload tests with fictitious/test data, then PHNs can request one to be created on the separate Developers PMHC MDS.  Just follow the instructions as outlined for software developers -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Annoucement for Developers site" href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2017/02/17/Separate-PMHC-MDS-now-available-for-software-developers-to-test-upload-files/">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        Client Key
			</h5>
      <p>
        We understand that PHNs are having difficulty with the requirement for there to be a stable and unique client key across their provider organisations. This is the problem that the Master Client Index (MCI) is being designed to help with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strategic Data have analysed the feedback from the one on one discussions with the volunteer PHNs, and passed this feedback onto The Department of Health. Options are currently being discussed. Once a decision has been reached it will be communicated to all PHNs.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Reporting timelines
			</h5>
      <p>
        The PMHC MDS won't remind users to upload data. PHNs will receive reporting dates from the Department. PHNs will need to manage within their own systems and remind Provider Organisations to upload if required.  We have listed a minimum expectation for upload timelines on the PMHC documentation site -
        <a title="PMHC MDS Reporting timelines" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/reporting-arrangements.html#reporting-timeliness">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>
        ATAPS news list communication
			</h5>
      <p>
        The ATAPS mailing list will no longer receive messages from the evaluation team at The University of Melbourne reminding them to upload data. This has caused some recent confusion for current Provider Organisations who are reporting data to the old ATAPS MDS. It is the responsibility of PHNs to manage the data that is entered into the ATAPS MDS.

      </p>
      <p>
        We understand you are all keen to hear more on what is currently in the development pipeline, and there are a lot of exciting features set with new releases to become a regular occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since our last PMHC MDS Helpdesk News Bulletin we have developed and released:
      </p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <h5>
        Milestone Releases
      </h5>
      <p>
        From recent Helpdesk PHN enquiries and discussions, Strategic Data has been able to advocate that for PHNs the Data Entry interface is more important to them than the Outcome Measures Self Service Interface. The Department has approved this development priority change and Strategic Data resources have been moved accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get Data Entry functionality to PHNs as soon as possible, development of this feature has been split into several components.  The first of these, Viewing Client Data, was released in <a title="PMHC MDS v0.9.2 News Annoucement" href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2017/05/18/Update-to-the-PMHC-MDS-v0-9-2-and-Data-Specifications-v1-0-6/">v0.9.2</a>.  As mentioned above, the remaining features will be rolled out iteratively over the coming weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next Milestone Releases will be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practitioners Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Client Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Episode Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Service Contacts Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>K5 and K10+ Outcome Measures Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>SDQ Outcome Measures Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Online K5 and K10+ Outcome Measures Self-Service Interface</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reporting is still in the early stages of development. Initial reports will be designed to assist data managers monitor the data that has been uploaded/entered into the PMHC MDS.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Stage Two
      </h5>
      <p>
        Once data entry has been implemented we will continue to focus on the remaining <a title="PMHC MDS Stage Two Development" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/development.html#development-of-the-pmhc-minimum-data-set">Stage Two</a> developments. Releases for these items will continue throughout this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once more information is available, we will circulate more specific timelines. Please regularly check the announcements on the <a title="PMHC MDS Home Page" href="https://pmhc-mds.com/#/">PMHC MDS home page</a> to keep informed.

		"title"    : "Master Client Index Volunteer Request - 29/3/2017",
		"date"     : "March 29, 2017",
		"content"  : "<p>Stage 2 development of the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS)  is currently underway. A requirement of the PMHC MDS is that a client key must be unique within each Primary Health Network (PHN) independent of the treating organisation. It is the responsibility of PHNs and Provider Organisations to co-ordinate to maintain this identifier. Clients should not be assigned multiple keys within the same PHN.</p>

<p>In order to help maintain the client key, a component of Stage 2 is to develop a Master Client Index (MCI). It is envisaged that Provider Organisations will be able to access the MCI in order to locate existing clients at other Provider Organisations with the same PHN and match the client key, or create a new client if the client does not yet exist in the MCI.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the MCI meets the needs of PHNs and Provider Organisations we would like to discuss the requirements with a volunteer group of PHNs and their Provider Organisations. These discussions would take the form of teleconferences and possibly one on one phone calls.</p>

<p>Organisations who are willing to volunteer are requested to email <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 7 April 2017.</p>

      <h4>Let's discuss PMHC MDS.</h4>
      <p class="large">
        The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) is live and ready for you to use in a way that best suits your organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) well underway to understanding how they will manage the PMHC MDS and developing best practice principles around collecting data, it is always a good opportunity to revisit the big picture discussion points. We have
        listed these on
        <a href="https://www.pmhc-mds.com/getstarted/" title="How to get started on the PMHC MDS">Getting Started on the PMHC MDS</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need a bit of inspiration or just want to ensure that you are on the right track with rolling out the PMHC MDS, please feel free to send the PMHC MDS Helpdesk an email on
        <a title="PMHC Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> to organise a time to chat further with us to answer any lingering question you may have. We are here to help make this transition
        as seamless as possible and it is also a great opportunity for us to understand what could be causing obstacles to PHNs.

          Helpdesk's hottest tip.

        <h5>
          Inform new users of the PMHC MDS invitation process
        </h5>
        <p>
          To avoid the invitation email and/or SMS token being deleted, it is always best to notify a user that you will be sending them a PMHC MDS invitation. Inform them that they will receive an invitation by email from noreply@strategicdata.com and a verification
          code via SMS. Please also provide them with the link to the online
          <a title="PMHC MDS User Guide" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/">User Guide</a> to read the steps they will need to complete to

      <h4>What are the hot topics?</h4>
      <p class="large">
        The PMHC MDS Helpdesk has had a few similar enquiries from various PHNs recently, and we thought it would be valuable to share these.
      </p>
      <h5>MHNIPS data collection</h5>
      <p>
        The Department of Health is expecting all commissioned Mental Health Nursing services data from July 2016 to be entered into the PMHC MDS -
        <a title="Documentation about collecting MHNIPs data" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/concepts-processes/outcome-measures.html#mhnip-outcome-measures">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>Capturing additional data</h5>
      <p>
        Organisations may collect extra information for their own analysis however this information does not need to be submitted to the PMHC MDS -
        <a title="Documentation about collecting extra data in the PMHC MDS" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/system/additional-data.html#capturing-additional-data">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>Fictitious data testing</h5>
      <p>
        The MDS is live and data uploads will be recorded. Real PMHC data can be trialled by
        <a title="Documentation about uploading a file to the PMHC MDS in test mode" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/upload.html#uploading-a-file-in-test-mode">uploading in test mode</a>, whereas fictitious
        data should be trialled with a 'Test Organisation' on developers.pmhc-mds.net -

      </p>
      <h5>Assignment of unique keys</h5>
      <p>
        PHNs have raised a number of queries about the assignment of unique keys.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit Identifier Management under Data Specifications -
          <a title="Information about identifier management" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/identifier-management.html">READ MORE</a>
        </li>
        <li>We have also dedicated a section on the FAQs page -

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Personal mobile phones</h5>
      <p>
        If a user is uneasy with providing their personal mobile phone number, please assure them that this mobile is only used by the PMHC MDS profile management system to deliver the verification code via SMS. This is used to activate their profile, reset their
        password or if a password is forgotten or expires. Users' mobile phone numbers are not listed or able to be viewed by other users within the PMHC MDS -
        <a title="Information about updating your details" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/home.html#updating-your-details">READ MORE</a>
      </p>
      <h5>Invitation failed error - An outstanding PMHC MDS invite exists</h5>
      <p>
        An invitation will be valid for 7 days and you can not resend an invitation within this time whilst a token is still valid.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If this user didn't receive the email invitation, ask them to double check their junk mail folder and search for an email sent from noreply@strategicdata.com.au. Otherwise they should contact the helpdesk on
          <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If this user didn't receive or deleted the email invitation or the SMS token, ask them to contact the helpdesk on
          <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> as we can reissue it.
        </li>
        <li>If the user has incorrectly entered their token after several attempts, this will cause the previous token to be invalid, then you will no longer receive this message and the invitation will be able to be resent
          again.</li>

        What to expect next?
      </h4>
      <p class="large">
        Let us delve into the developer's world - If you are game then we are too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you have had the opportunity to see the basic PMHC MDS in the December training sessions, I'm sure you are all keen to hear more on what is currently in the development pipeline, and there are a lot of exciting features currently consuming our
        developers' time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The below milestones have been set with new releases to become a regular occurrence. Some features may be a lot of work for a back end developer but will offer minimal visual impact to the current user interface, others will have a significant change
        to the look and will streamline user functionality, or to provide additional and much awaited tools to the website.
      </p>
      <h5>Next Milestone Releases will be:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Limit organisation structure to two levels</li>
        <li>View Client Data</li>
        <li>Online K5 client/practitioner tool</li>
        <li>Basic Summary Reports</li>
        <li>Online K10+ and SDQ client/practitioner tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our long term goal is still focussed on Stage Two release. As the Department has previously announced, it is scheduled for mid 2017 and will feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Entry Interface</li>
        <li>Comprehensive Reports</li>
        <li>Master Client Index</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are continually trying to improve the user experience, and greatly appreciate your questions, feedback and suggestions, so please don't hesitate to drop us a line or two at <a title="PMHC MDS Support email" href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will be available for all Primary Health Networks (PHNs) to commence uploading data in early December. Prior to this we are looking for between 5 and 10 PHNs to volunteer as early adopters. These PHNs will commence upload from the 7th of November, and help us to streamline the system prior to making it available to all PHNs from the beginning of December.</p>

<p>We would like some of the early adopters to be uploading zipped csv files and some to be uploading Excel spreadsheets. They will need to be willing to provide feedback on the process used to give the primary contact user access to the system, the usability of the system, and the documentation and training.</p>

<p>Benefits of moving to the PMHC include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early access to features which are not included in the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS:</li>
<li>Partitioning of provider organisations within a PHN so that provider organisations can only access their own data.</li>
<li>Delegation of user management to each provider organisation.</li>
<li>Reduced data collection burden due to not needing to collect data items that have been retired from the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com?Subject=PMHC%20MDS%20Request%20for%20early%20adopters" target="_top">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by Friday the 28th of October, 2016 if you would like to volunteer. PHNs who have been selected to be early adopters will be notified on Wednesday the 2nd of November, 2016.</p>

<p>Additionally there are still a few PHNs who have not yet submitted a 'Letter of Authority' it would be appreciated if you could address this as a matter of priority. If you are unsure we will be following up with individual PHN's in the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

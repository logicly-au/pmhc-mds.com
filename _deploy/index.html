        <p>Funding by the Australian Government Department of Health has been provided to
Primary Health Networks (PHNs) through a Primary Mental Health Care flexible
funding pool to support commissioning of mental health and suicide prevention
services in six key service delivery areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low intensity psychological interventions for people with, or at risk of,
mild mental illness;</li>
  <li>psychological therapies delivered by mental health professionals to under
serviced groups;</li>
  <li>early intervention services for children and young people with, or at risk of
mental illness;</li>
  <li>services for people with severe and complex mental illness who are being
managed in a primary care setting;</li>
  <li>enhanced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health services; and</li>
  <li>a regional approach to suicide prevention activities with a focus on improved
follow-up for people who have attempted suicide or are at high risk of suicide.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will provide the
basis for PHNs and the Department of Health to monitor and report on the quantity and quality of service delivery, and to inform future improvements in the planning and funding of primary mental health care services funded by the Australian Government.</p>

<p>The data reported by PHNs through the PMHC MDS will form the basis for
production of key performance indicators used to monitor services delivered
across the 31 PHN regions covered by PHNs.</p>

<p><a href="//www.strategicdata.com.au/">Strategic Data Pty Ltd</a> has been contracted by the Department of Health to manage the PMHC MDS on its behalf.</p>

<p>A <a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/">specification</a> of the data items to be collected in the PMHC MDS is available.</p>

<p>If you would like to be notified about updates to this specification or
announcements about the rollout of the PMHC MDS please subscribe to the
PMHC MDS mailing list by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:sympa@lists.pmhc-mds.com?subject=subscribe%20news">sympa@lists.pmhc-mds.com</a> with the subject “subscribe news@lists.pmhc-mds.com”. This is not a general discussion list. Only moderated users can send

      <a href="/communications/#/2017/10/25/Update-to-the-PMHC-MDS-v-0-17-2/"><h4>Update to the PMHC MDS - 25/10/2017</h4></a>
      <h4 id="pmhc-mds-update-v0172">PMHC MDS Update v0.17.2</h4>

<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v0.17.2 was released on
October 25, 2017.</p>

<p>The following feature have been implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deletion of records via both the data entry interface and uploads.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following updates and bugfixes have been implemented in the data entry
interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Restricted the use of the ‘Complex Care Package’ Principal Focus of Treatment
Plan to the three selected Lead PHNs</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the Suicide Referral icon was showing on episode
summaries where the Suicide Referral Flag was set to ‘Unknown’</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue with the User Invite form where users could be invited to a
Provider Organisation with the Organisation Management role. This role is
restricted to PHN level.</li>
  <li>Added the Episode Key onto the Collection Occasion details/edit forms.</li>
  <li>Changed the sorting of Country of Birth and Main Language Spoken at Home so
that the top ten languages/country of births as reported in the 2011 census
are moved to the top of the list.</li>
  <li>The service contact postcode field is now prefilled with 9999 for all non
Face to Face modalities.</li>
  <li>Fixed an bug where the “Unknown” option was not being given for Suicide
Referral Flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following updates and bugfixes have been implemented in the upload
interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed an error in uploads when there was no practitioners file.</li>
  <li>Restricted the use of the ‘Complex Care Package’ Principal Focus of Treatment
Plan to the three selected Lead PHNs</li>
  <li>Improved the error message ‘Collection date must not be after Episode end
date’ so that it includes information about the episode key and collection
occasion key.</li>
  <li>Improved the error message ‘Client may not have multiple open episodes. This
client has an existing open episode within this organisation’ so that it
includes information about the client key and episode keys.</li>
  <li>Split the error message ‘Invalid episode_completion_status on row [x]. Where
service contact - final is recorded as “No further services planned” the
episode completion status should be recorded using one of the treatment
concluded responses.’ so that one message is returned when an episode has
a completion status but no end date and another error is returned when an
episode has an end date but no completion status.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved error messages like the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>…organisation_path / client_key value of “…” is invalid.</li>
      <li>…organisation_path / episode_key value of “…” is invalid.</li>
      <li>…organisation_path / practitioner_key value of “…” is invalid.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Return a sensible error instead of “episode: new row for relation “episode”
violates check constraint “end_after_referral” / Failing row contains (…).</li>
  <li>Return a sensible error instead of “client: new row for relation “client”
violates check constraint “past_date” / Failing row contains (…).</li>
</ul>

<p>The user guide has been updated to reflect these updates. It is available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/user-documentation/</a>.</p>

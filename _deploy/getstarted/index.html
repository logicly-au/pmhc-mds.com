<h4 id="step-1-decide-how-to-create-upload-files-for-the-pmhc-mds">Step 1. Decide how to create upload files for the PMHC MDS</h4>

<p>Before the PMHC MDS goes live, each PHN, in conjunction with their provider
organisations, will need to analyse the data requirements and either organise
to have their client management systems altered to produce the files required
for upload or understand how to manually create the required Excel spreadsheets.
Please refer to the draft <a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/upload-specification.html">upload specification</a>.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-update-client-forms">Step 2. Update client forms</h4>

<p>Before the PMHC MDS goes live, each PHN, in conjunction with their provider
organisations, will need to update their client forms in order to collect all
the data required for the PMHC MDS. Please refer to the draft
<a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-model-and-specifications.html">data specification</a> and notes on
<a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/form-creation.html">creating forms</a>.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-assign-a-primary-contact">Step 3. Assign a primary contact</h4>

<p>Before the PMHC MDS goes live each PHN needs to assign a primary contact. This
is the person who will have overall responsibility for PMHC MDS data management
within your PMHC.</p>

<p>A letter of authority is a request made on your PHN or Non-Government Health
Organisation’s (NGHO) letterhead which must be signed by an authority at the
PHN or NGHO who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the
account is being created (i.e., the person’s manager or the CEO).</p>

<p>This letter must contain the following details for the primary contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Mobile phone number</li>
  <li>Title/Position</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, if any of your provider organisations will be exporting data from client systems could you please include the contact details of their software provider so that we can keep the software providers informed about the development of the PMHC MDS and offer them accounts that can be used to test upload their exports.</p>

<p>This letter must be faxed to Strategic Data at (03) 9340 9090 or scanned then
emailed to <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.</p>

<p>An email address and a mobile phone number are required for security purposes
and will be used when the user initially sets their password or needs to reset
a forgotten password.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-initial-login">Step 3. Initial login</h4>

<p>When the PMHC MDS is available, the primary contact will be given login details.</p>

<p>The PMHC MDS model allows PHNs to setup provider organisations underneath the
PHN.</p>

<p>The primary contact user will initially need to login to the PMHC MDS and create each of these provider organisations.</p>

<p>The information required about each provider organisation is defined in
the draft <a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-model-and-specifications.html#provider-organisation-data-elements">PMHC MDS specifications</a>.</p>

<p>At least one user within each provider organisation will also need to be
created with the ‘Upload’ role so that provider organisations can upload data.</p>

<p>The PMHC MDS allows flexibility in the way in which PHNs devolve authority to
their provider organisations. In order to manage users a PMHC MDS user needs to
be granted the ‘User Management’ role. The primary contact user will be granted
this role and in turn they will be able to grant this role to any other user
within their PHN or the PHN’s provider organisations.</p>

<p>This means that PHNs can devolve user management authority to one or more users
in a provider organisation so that the provider organisation can manage their
own logins, or a PHN can choose to keep user management authority at the level
of the PHN requiring each provider organisation to contact the PHN when they
need a new user added.</p>

<p>Once the primary user has set up the provider organisations and associated user
accounts the PMHC MDS is ready for data upload. Separate data upload
documentation will be available.</p>

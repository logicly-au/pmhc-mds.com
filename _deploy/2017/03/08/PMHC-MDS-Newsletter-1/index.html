                                        The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) is live and ready for you to use in a way that best suits your organisation.

                                        With Primary Health Networks (PHNs) well underway to understanding how they will manage the PMHC MDS and developing best practice principles around collecting data, it is always a good opportunity to revisit the big picture discussion points. We have
                                        listed these on

                                        Now that you have had the opportunity to see the basic PMHC MDS in the December training sessions, I'm sure you are all keen to hear more on what is currently in the development pipeline, and there are a lot of exciting features currently consuming our
                                        developers' time.

                                        The below milestones have been set with new releases to become a regular occurrence. Some features may be a lot of work for a back end developer but will offer minimal visual impact to the current user interface, others will have a significant change
                                        to the look and will streamline user functionality, or to provide additional and much awaited tools to the website.

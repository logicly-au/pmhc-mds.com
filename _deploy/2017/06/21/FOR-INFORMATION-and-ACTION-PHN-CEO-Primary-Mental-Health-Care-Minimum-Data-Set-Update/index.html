        <p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs on Tuesday 20 June 2017.</p>

<p>-----------------------</p>

<p>Dear PHN CEOs,</p>

<p>From 1 July 2017, PHNs are expected to be uploading data into the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS). The following provides CEOs an update on the transition to full compliance and the master client index.</p>

<p><b>Transition to Full Compliance</b></p>

<p>Previous communications have indicated that the existing Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) / Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) MDS would be shut down when the PMHC MDS data entry interface was implemented. Due to difficulties in converting the data between the two systems, the ATAPS/MHSRA system will continue until further notice.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2017, full compliance with the PMHC MDS is still expected. However, this means all consenting clients referred for mental health services from 1 July 2017 have information entered into the PMHC MDS. Existing clients whose data has been entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS may continue to do so. However, new referrals should NOT be entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS from 1 July 2017.</p>

<p>Options for reporting and transferring active ATAPS referrals into the new PMHC MDS have been considered by the PMHC MDS Working Group and three options have been agreed for addressing the needs. Each PHN must choose only one option, their preferred option, of the three presented below.</p>

<p>Once selected, please have your PMHC MDS Data Primary User advise your preferred option to Strategic Data at <a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 1 July 2017. Strategic Data will then work with the PHN on their preferred option.</p>

<p><i>Option one</i></p>
<p>The ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS will be kept online for up to 12 months to allow for those existing client referrals already receiving services under the old ‘ATAPS’ system to be maintained until all sessions associated with that referral are complete.</p>

<p>This option requires PHNs and their organisations to work with two data collections, ie: The PMHC MDS for new clients / episodes commencing post 1 July 2017 and the old ATAPS system for existing clients who have not completed their treatment.</p>

<p><i>Option two</i></p>
<p>Strategic Data will provide the PHN an <i>ATAPS MDS data extract in PMHC MDS upload format</i>. The extract will contain ATAPS clients and their associated data where a client had an associated session in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Note that, ATAPS does not associate clients with provider organisations, which is a structural element required for the PMHC MDS. Therefore, the organisation path in this extract will be empty and the PHN will need to assign each client to their correct provider organisation. Any other data which cannot be mapped from ATAPS to PMHC data definitions will be set as missing. Each record will have the ‘!ATAPS’ tag added so records exported from ATAPS can be identified in future analysis.</p>

<p>This option will require significant work by the PHN to assign provider organisations to each client and significant amounts of missing data on the migrated clients.</p>

<p><i>Option three</i></p>
<p>Where PHNs are implementing new clients systems, they may choose to map the ATAPS data to PMHC data and then upload to the PMHC MDS directly from their client system. PHNs choosing this option will be provided with specifications of the <i>mapping of ATAPS to PMHC format</i> being used to produce the ATAPS MDS data extract at option two. This option requires PHNs to follow this mapping format to provide consistency in mapped ATAPS data.</p>

<p><b>Master Client Index</b></p>

<p>The current PMHC MDS specification requires a Client Key that is unique and stable at the PHN regional level, not at the provider organisation level. The purpose of the Master Client Index is to help PHNs and their provider organisations manage client information across the PHN region. This requirement has proven problematic for PHNs and is being worked through by the PMHC MDS Working Group.</p>

<p>To determine what issues exist with managing the client key and possible solutions, nine PHNs worked with Strategic Data to describe their models for triaging patients, the information systems being used by PHNs and provider organisations, the ease of updating information systems and resources available for manual reconciliation of clients.</p>

<p>As a result of this work, a Master Client Index is not possible at this time, and as such, will not be a requirement for full compliance from 1 July 2017. The requirement will now be organisational uniqueness instead of regional level uniqueness until this can be addressed.</p>

<p>The PMHC Working Group agrees that the opportunity for national and regional level uniqueness is an aspiration and will continue to be investigated by the Department. The Department is currently looking into the use of Healthcare Identifiers and will provide you with updates as this work progresses.</p>

<p>If you have any further queries, please email: <a href="mailto:mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au">mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

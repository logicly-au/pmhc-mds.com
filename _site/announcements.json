The Wayback reports have been rebranded \nand moved to the standard reports tab as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>W1: Wayback Quarterly Report Template rebrand to W1:  Universal Aftercare \nQuarterly Report Template. The W1 can be accessed by selecting Universal \nAftercare as the only Data Source.</li>\n  <li>The W2: High level summary of overall volumes by entity report has been\nretired. Counts of Universal Aftercare records can now be accessed via\nthe existing A1 report.</li>\n  <li>W3: Data Quality Report: Missing TWB Episode data rebranded to \nA14: Data quality report - Missing UA Episode data</li>\n  <li>W4: Data Quality Report: Missing TWB Needs Identification and Recommendation \nOuts rebranded to A15: Data quality report - Missing UA Needs Identification \nand Recommendation Outs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The following new reports have been implemented:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A new A13: Data quality report — Universal Aftercare episodes with no linked \nUA episode record</li>\n  <li>M1: Client wait time</li>\n  <li>M2: Activity Reports by Age group</li>\n  <li>M3: Activity Reports by Gender</li>\n  <li>M4: Activity Reports by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status</li>\n  <li>M5: IAR-DST - Recommended Level of Care</li>\n  <li>M6: IAR-DST - Recommended Level of Care, where intake referred to MMHC</li>\n  <li>M7: Monthly service activity</li>\n  <li>M8: Episode of care characteristics</li>\n  <li>M9: Activity Report: Service contact type</li>\n  <li>M10: Activity Report: Service contact duration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Reports can now be filtered with the new !uaooh tag. Reports can no longer be \nfiltered with the !wayback tag.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"known-issues\">Known Issues</h5>\n\n<p>In the Version 5.0 format, Program Type 2: Head to Health Clinic is only \naccepted for remaining temporary Head to Health Clinics in New South Wales \nand Victoria. An error will be produced for any other organisation. Similarly \nProgram Type 3: will always produce an error. While data suppliers must \nensure the data stored in their systems can be used to meet the PMHC-MDS \nspecification that does not place any specific constraints as to how or what \ndata organisations store locally, it only places requirements around what \nformat data is supplied to the PMHC MDS. Therefore, the Version 5.0 changes \ndo not automatically mean that organisations will need to make adjustments \nto their existing source data.</p>\n\n<p>However, uploads need to be internally consistent. This means that where \nservice contact or collection occasion data is modified, the linked episode \nand client must also be included in the upload. Therefore, when uploading in \nVersion 5 all existing episodes must use Program Types accepted by the Version \n5.0 specification. Logicly is aware that not being able to continue to submit \nvalues 2: Head to Health and 3: AMHC for existing episodes may cause issues \nfor some organisations and is investigating improvements that would allow \nthe submission of the original values.</p>\n\n<p>The current W1: Universal Aftercare Quarterly Report Template is a simplified \nversion of the previous Excel report. A CSV report that is similar to the \nExcel report will be released shortly.</p>\n\n<p>The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available\nat <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/</a>.</p>\n"

Under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement bilateral\nschedules, states and territories have flexibility to implement and adapt aftercare service\nmodels to meet the needs of local communities, while contributing to national availability of\naftercare supports. These updates to the PMHC MDS are designed to support improved\nmonitoring, evaluation, and comparability of services across jurisdictions, and will be\naccompanied by updated technical documentation and guidance.</p>\n\n<p>To support the information in this circular, PHNs are asked to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ensure relevant staff receive and review the information provided in this circular.</li>\n  <li>Ensure all data for MMHCs is uploaded in accordance with the guidance provided in this\ncircular by 1 October 2025.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Ensure all Universal Aftercare data is uploaded to the PMHC MDS in line with relevant\nguidance provided.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Further guidance regarding Universal Aftercare rebrand will be provided in due\ncourse.\nFor any questions regarding this information please contact <a href=\"mailto:MentalHealthData@health.gov.au\">MentalHealthData@health.gov.au</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"background-2025x08x15\">Background</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"mmhcs\">MMHCs</h6>\n\n<p>As of July 2025, there are 41 Centres open nationally. Medicare Mental Health Centres provide a\nwelcoming place where everyone can access free mental health information, services and\nsupports. Centres are staffed by a team of qualified mental health professionals and people\nwith lived experience of mental health. Support through the Centres is free for everyone who\nwalks in the door. Consumers do not need an appointment or a referral.</p>\n\n<p>As all Medicare Mental Health Centres have been rebranded, there are new additions to the\navailable domains in the PMHC MDS which are incorporated under Program Type, Funding\nSource and Organisation Type.</p>\n\n<p>For policy and funding queries about the Medicare Mental Health Centres program, please\ncontact <a href=\"mailto:Mental.Health.Liaison@health.gov.au\">Mental.Health.Liaison@health.gov.au</a>.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"universal-aftercare\">Universal Aftercare</h6>\n\n<p>The Way Back Support Service was originally developed and delivered by Beyond Blue as a trial\nsuicide aftercare model, with the Australian Government subsequently funding roll-out of this\nmodel in several jurisdictions. Under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention\nAgreement, the Commonwealth and states and territories agreed to be jointly responsible for\nproviding aftercare programs, which reflect and respond to local needs and circumstance. This\nshift marked the evolution of aftercare services from a specific model, available in some\njurisdictions, to a nationally supported and scalable program now referred to as Universal\nAftercare.</p>\n\n<p>To reflect this transition, and ensure consistency in data collection and reporting, references to\nThe Way Back in the PMHC MDS will be rebranded to Universal Aftercare. This includes\nintroducing a dedicated Universal Aftercare Program Type. This will also include the\nintroduction of a new tag for the Universal Aftercare Outside of Hospital/Expanded Referral\nPathway Trial. These changes will support improved monitoring, evaluation, and comparability\nof aftercare services across jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p>For policy or funding queries, please contact <a href=\"mailto:SuicidePrevention@health.gov.au\">SuicidePrevention@health.gov.au</a>.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"key-changes-2025x08x15\">Key Changes</h5>\n\n<p>Two data specification updates are planned to implement both the MMHC and Universal\nAftercare changes.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"version-411-next-planned-release\">Version 4.1.1 (next planned release)</h6>\n\n<p>Version 4.1.1 begins the rebranding of AMHC and Head to Health to MMHC. It will include the\nfollowing changes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A ‘8: MMHC’ response will be added to Program Type on both the Intake and Episode\nrecords.</li>\n  <li>Response ‘24: Head to Health Kids Hubs’ on Funding Source will be renamed to ‘24:\nKids Hubs’ on the Service Contact record</li>\n  <li>A ‘28: MMHC’ response will be added to Funding Source on the Service Contact record</li>\n  <li>A ‘45: MMHC’ response will be added to Organisation type referred to at Intake\nconclusion on the Intake record</li>\n  <li>A ‘25: MMHC’ response will be added to Organisation type referred to at Episode\nconclusion on the Episode record</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Version 4.1.1 is backwards compatible with Version 4.1.0. Only organisations using the above\nresponses will need to change their uploads.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"version-50-to-be-released-end-of-november\">Version 5.0 (to be released end of November)</h6>\n\n<p>Version 5.0 will complete the rebranding to MMHC and Universal Aftercare. It will include the\nfollowing changes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A ‘9: Universal Aftercare’ response will be added to the Program Type field on both the\nIntake and Episode tables</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Seven entirely new tables will be added corresponding to the existing tables in the\nWayback extension. These tables will only need to be submitted where Episodes using\nthe new ‘9: Universal Aftercare’ Program Type are included</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>UA Episode</li>\n      <li>UA Recommendation Out</li>\n      <li>UA Critical Incident</li>\n      <li>UA Plan</li>\n      <li>UA Needs Identification (NI)</li>\n      <li>SIDAS</li>\n      <li>WHO-5</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The following changes will be applied to the Program Type field on both the Intake and\nEpisode tables:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>‘2: Head to Health’ renamed to ‘2: Head to Health Clinic’. This response is only\nto be used by remaining temporary Head to Health Clinics in NSW and Victoria.\nPlease refer to Program Type for more information</li>\n      <li>‘3: AMHC’ will be retired. An error will be returned if this response is used</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, the following changes will also be included in Version 5.0:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A new Veteran field will be added to the Intake and Episode tables. This field was\nincluded in The Way Back specification. There is a new IAR-DST variant in development\nfor Veterans. Veterans will be included on the Intake and Episode tables instead of the\nnew UA Episode table so that it can be used for monitoring both the IAR-DST and\nUniversal Aftercare</li>\n  <li>A new IAR-DST - Practitioner Reason for Override will be added to the IAR-DST table</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When Version 5 is released, existing episodes tagged with !wayback will be migrated to the new\nUniversal Aftercare Program Type. The !wayback tag will be retained for historical reference\nonly.</p>\n\n<p>Uploading of both the new Version 5 specification as well as continued upload of the existing\nVersion 4.1 specification/Version 3 Wayback extension will be allowed for a 6-month period.\nDuring this period, any data uploaded under the Version 4.1 or Version 3.0 Wayback\nspecifications will be migrated during the upload process. After the 6-month period, only\nVersion 5 uploads will be accepted.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"universal-aftercare-outside-of-hospitalexpanded-referral-pathway-trial\">Universal Aftercare Outside of Hospital/Expanded Referral Pathway Trial</h6>\n\n<p>A new system tag (!uaooh) will be introduced at the same time as Version 5 to distinguish\nepisodes under the Universal Aftercare Outside of Hospital/Expanded Referral Pathway\nTrial. The !uaooh tag will only be allowed on Episode records where the Program Type is ‘9:\nUniversal Aftercare’.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"reporting-2025x08x15\">Reporting</h6>\n\n<p>The existing Way Back-specific reports (W1–W4) will be retired and replaced with updated\nreports in the standard reports tab (the W1 report will be converted from a downloadable Excel\ntemplate to a CSV format). These will be accessible to PHNs, the Department, and State and\nTerritory Health Departments/Agencies.</p>\n\n<p>New reports are also in development to support MMHC.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"action-required-2025x08x15\">Action required</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"mmhcs-1\">MMHCs</h6>\n\n<p>When Version 4.1.1 is released, Medicare Mental Health Centres should use the new domains\nfor Program Type, Funding Source and Organisation Type as outlined above. The Head to Health\nor AMHC Program Types should no longer be used.</p>\n\n<p>Medicare Mental Health Centres may wish to amend data retrospectively using these new\ndomains, but this is not mandatory.</p>\n\n<p>Remaining temporary Head to Health Clinics in NSW and Victoria should not use the new\nMMHC domains and continue use of the Head to Health Program Type.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"universal-aftercare-1\">Universal Aftercare</h6>\n\n<p>A draft Version 5.0 specification will shortly be published. PHNs or service providers should\nimplement changes to their system so that they can start providing data in the Version 5.0\nformat when it is released. Further guidance will be provided in due course to support a smooth\ntransition. Once the rebrand is in place, all Universal Aftercare data – including data collected\nthrough the Outside of Hospital/Expanded Referral Pathway Trial – must be reported using the\nUniversal Aftercare Program Type in the PMHC MDS. Additionally, data collected as part of the\ntrial must be tagged with the new identifier to ensure it is easily distinguishable within the\ndataset. This will support accurate tracking and analysis of trial-specific outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>For technical support regarding the PMHC MDS, please contact Logicly at <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.</p>\n"

There are two types of tags available to users in the PMHC MDS; <em>system</em> tags that start with “!” and <em>user</em> tags that do not start with “!”. <em>System</em> tags beginning with an exclamation mark (!) are reserved for use by the department only.</p>\n\n<p><em>System</em> tags have been used to implement extension data specifications such as Wayback (!wayback) and headspace (!headspace). They have also been used to record data where extra partitioning of data was needed for reporting purposes. An example of this was for the bushfire response in 2020. A !br20 tag was implemented to track episodes where one or more services were funded through the bushfire response. The current list of reserved system tags is available at <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/reserved-tags.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/reserved-tags.html</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>User</em> tags can be used by PHNs/POs to tag records in order to partition data to accommodate local requirements as desired.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"action-required\">Action required</h5>\n\n<p>PHNs and their POs are asked to review and audit their tags in the PMHC MDS to ensure they have been entered correctly (e.g., no missing commas between tags). Of particular note, multiple tags can be added to a record by separating them with commas. Some of the existing tags may have been meant to have been multiple tags, but they have not been comma separated, so instead one long tag has been added. For example a record may have a tag ‘!covid19 this is an example !br20’ whereas the intention was to have the three tags:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>!covid19</li>\n  <li>this is an example</li>\n  <li>!br20</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tags can contain lower case letters (or will get lowercased), numbers, dashes, spaces, and “!”. Leading and trailing spaces will be stripped.</p>\n\n<p>As of 1 May 2025 the PMHC MDS will only accept system tags that are in the reserved list.</p>\n\n<p>For technical support, please contact Logicly at <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.</p>\n"

		"content": "<p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs in October 2024.</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>PHN CEO Circular October 2024</strong></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-sites-field-in-the-pmhc-mds\">New Sites Field in the PMHC MDS</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"overview-2024x10\">Overview</h5>\n\n<p>This circular is to inform you about an upcoming addition to the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) that will allow for data to be captured at a more granular level in cases where a provider organisation operates out of multiple sites within the same PHN.</p>\n\n<p>This will be done by implementing a new data field called “sites” to the service contact record. The sites field will be available for all PHNs to use but is only a mandatory field for Medicare Mental Health Centres (MMHCs, formerly Head to Health) to enable more accurate routine program monitoring of these services.</p>\n\n<p>To support the information in this circular, PHNs are asked to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ensure relevant staff receive and review the information on the new sites field.</li>\n  <li>Share the guidance regarding the new sites field with relevant staff and service providers by 31 October 2024.</li>\n  <li>Begin uploading to the PMHC MDS under v4.1 by 30 April 2025 before the v4.0 specification is phased out.</li>\n  <li>Ensure all Medicare Mental Health Centres are named according to the guidance provided in this circular.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For any questions regarding this information please contact <a href=\"mailto:MentalHealthData@health.gov.au\">MentalHealthData@health.gov.au</a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"background-2024x10\">Background</h5>\n\n<p>Provision of information via the PMHC MDS is necessary for governments to undertake their role in funding, monitoring, and planning future national service delivery. The introduction of the new sites field aims to address the limitation that occurs when the same Provider Organisation (PO) is delivering services across multiple ‘sites’ within a PHN region. For each MMHC, a ‘site’ may be defined as a PO’s distinct service venue where there is more than one MMHC within the PHN region.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the department consulted PHNs via the Head to Health Data Leads Community of Practice about the proposed new sites field in the PMHC MDS. Overall, the solution was supported. Some PHNs noted it could also be helpful for contract management and monitoring of other programs. At this stage, implementation of the new sites field is only mandatory for MMHCs.</p>\n\n<p>For services that are not required to follow the MMHC naming guidance, a ‘site’ may be interpreted as a mechanism to differentiate activity occurring within a PO either physically, functionally, or contractually where PHNs feel this is the most appropriate way to record their data.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"addition-technical-details-2024x10\">Additional Technical details</h5>\n\n<p>If PHNs wish to begin system preparation in advance the draft specification is available at: <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/\" target=\"_blank\">Draft PMHC MDS Data Specification 4.1.0-Draft documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The sites field will be introduced with the release of PMHC MDS specification v4.1 which is anticipated to occur in November 2024. PHNs are encouraged to begin submitting data to v4.1 as soon as convenient but to allow for the transition v4.0 will not be decommissioned until April 2025. By this date, all PHNs and/or their service providers that upload to the PMHC MDS will need to upgrade to v4.1 before the v4.0 specification is phased out.</p>\n\n<p>POs will have the ability to create sites for their organisation. Relevant staff may define the list of sites via upload or data entry. For data entry, the sites field will only be displayed on the Service Contact data entry form if there are sites defined for a PO. If there are sites defined for a PO, the service_contact_site field must be one of the defined sites of the PO. If there are no sites defined for a PO, the data entry form will not have any changes to how it currently appears for the v4.0 specification. The Logicly help desk is available to support PHNs with technical questions in relation to the implementation of the sites field.</p>\n\n<p>The addition of the sites field does <em>not</em> apply to data submitted under the WayBack extension.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"naming-guidance-2024x10\">Naming Guidance</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"mmhc-2024x10\">MMHC</h6>\n\n<p>POs should ensure that site names are clear and easily distinguishable from other MMHCs and services in their PHN region. To support accurate reporting and monitoring of service activity data through the PMHC MDS, it is recommended that the MMHC location is included in the site name (e.g., Townsville MMHC should include ‘Townsville’ somewhere in the site name such as TOWNSVILLE2024). Where a single MMHC is operating across more than one location, it is at the discretion of the PO whether to include this level of detail in the site name. PHNs can contact the Department <a href=\"mailto:MentalHealthData@health.gov.au\">(MentalHealthData@health.gov.au)</a> to discuss individual requirements about implementing the MMHC naming guidance, as needed.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"other-2024x10\">Other</h6>\n\n<p>PHNs and POs who wish to utilise the sites field for services that are not delivered through MMHCs are requested to name sites in a reasonable and sensible way that maintains confidentiality for the relevant provider and complies with privacy legislation.   Logicly have updated the guidance available via the PMHC MDS data specification to include general naming guidance and validation requirements for the sites field: <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/\" target=\"_blank\">Draft PMHC MDS Data Specification 4.1.0-Draft documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"action-required-2024x10\">Action Required</h5>\n\n<p>The v4.1 specification is planned for release from 1 November 2024. PHNs will be notified through a system release e-mail notification from Logicly’s PMHC-MDS support service. Once released, PHNs will need to ensure that this information is distributed to relevant staff and service providers, and that their processes are updated accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>PHNs are encouraged to begin submitting data under PMHC MDS specification v4.1 once it is released. For a 6-month period from the v4.1 release date, the PMHC MDS will still accept the v4.0 upload format before it is phased out.</p>\n\n<p>For technical support, please contact Logicly at <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.</p>\n"

Introduction</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"111-intake-context\">1.1.1. Intake Context</h6>\n\n<p>Where an organisation is only providing intake services and not providing any treatment services, they can use the following data model to submit data to the PMHC-MDS:</p>\n\n<p>[image]</p>\n\n<p>In the Intake context the following records will need to be provided:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Client</li>\n  <li>Intake</li>\n  <li>IAR-DST</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Episode and Service contact activity is not submitted in this context.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ed0000\">The collection of Intake and IAR data may not be required for all programs. Please see 5.3.5 Intake.</span></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"12-new-records-and-fields-in-version-4\">1.2. New Records and Fields in Version 4</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"121-intake\">1.2.1. Intake</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ed0000\">The model now records a new Intake record where an episode has undertaken an Intake process. The collection of Intake and IAR data may not be required for all programs. Please see 5.3.5 Intake.</span></p>\n\n<p>The Intake table records information about the intake.</p>\n\n<p>Organisation Path and Intake Key are the two fields required to link the Intake record at the intake provider organisation to the Episode record at the treatment organisation.</p>\n\n<p>The values of these fields should be passed along by the intake organisation to the treatment organisation where the treatment organisation will use them to fill in Intake Organisation Path and Intake Key. This will then link the Intake record at the intake organisation with the Episode record at the treatment organisation.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"122-iar-dst-measure\">1.2.2. IAR-DST Measure</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ed0000\">The model now captures</span> the domains and the recommended level of care pertinent to the IAR-DST that clients have completed for them as part of the intake process. A new IAR-DST record will be created for each intake process.</p>\n\n<p>Consistent with the existing measures in the MDS, the domain scores will be captured as well as the recommended level of care. The purpose of collecting both domain scores and recommended level of care is to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>allow verification of IAR-DST scoring processes, thereby catching scoring implementation errors early should they arise, and</li>\n  <li>provide a resource that can be used to better understand how the IAR-DST scoring algorithm performs in real world environments supporting ongoing improvement of the tool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ed0000\">The collection of Intake and IAR data may not be required for all programs. Please see 5.3.5 Intake.</span></p>\n\n<h6 id=\"123-episode-and-intake-episode\">1.2.3. Episode and Intake Episode</h6>\n\n<p>When the client is referred to a PMHC MDS reporting treatment service a new Episode record is created.\nWhere the client has been referred via an intake process, an additional Intake Episode record is also created.</p>\n\n<p>The Intake Episode table comprises a composite foreign key to link it back to an episode record on which all the episode information is recorded. This linkage is done via two fields:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The identifier of the intake team (Intake Organisation Path)</li>\n  <li>The episode identifier of the intake team (Intake Key)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Episode record has been expanded with one new field - the organisation(s) to which the organisation refers the client (Organisation type referred to at Episode conclusion)</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ed0000\">The collection of Intake and IAR data may not be required for all programs. Please see 5.3.5 Intake.</span></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"52-key-concepts\">5.2 Key concepts</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"525-intake\">5.2.5. Intake</h6>\n\n<p>For the purpose of the PMHC MDS, an Intake is defined as a point of contact between a client and a PHN-commissioned organisation where the client is assessed to determine the appropriate level of care and referred to a service provider to provide clinical care. An Intake may include the collection of an IAR-DST measure.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ed0000\">The collection of Intake and IAR data may not be required for all programs. Please see 5.3.5 Intake.</span></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"53-record-formats\">5.3 Record formats</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"535-intake\">5.3.5 Intake</h6>\n\n<p>See Intake for definition of an intake.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ed0000\">The collection of Intake and IAR data is a requirement for Head to Health programs.

The information outlined in this circular applies to all Primary Health Networks (PHNs).</p>\n\n<p>To support this change, PHNs are asked to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ensure relevant staff and provider organisations are aware of the upcoming v4 release and are subscribed to receive communications from Logicly’s PMHC MDS support service if they don’t already have a login to the PMHC MDS.</li>\n  <li>Prepare to transition data collection and upload arrangements in line with the new v4 specification within six months of the release during week of 1 August 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PHNs will be notified of the system release through a system release communication via Logicly. The Department and Logicly have conducted extensive preparation to facilitate the v4 release in consultation with PMHC MDS Data Reference Group. We have automated as much of the process as possible and this circular outlines actions we require of PHNs.</p>\n\n<p>Information materials are available from Logicly’s PMHC MDS support service at: <a href=\"https://pmhc-mds.com/communications\" target=\"_blank\">https://pmhc-mds.com/communications</a>.

Key changes are outlined in <a href=\"#attachmenta-2022x07x29\" target=\"_blank\">Attachment A</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A summary of the changes and the steps necessary for PHNs to upgrade to v4 are available at <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/changes-from-v2.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/changes-from-v2.html</a>.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"steps-to-transition-and-upgrade\">Steps to transition and upgrade</h5>\n\n<p>The v4 release will be in the week of 1 August 2022. To enable PHNs and provider organisations to successfully transition from current versions and extensions to v4, the transition of data collection and uploads must commence within six months of the release date in line with the new v4 specification. This may include upgrading Client Information Management Systems to collect new data such as program type and funding source. To effectively manage transition, data uploaded in existing versions and extensions will be instantly mapped to v4 when uploaded.</p>\n\n<p>Additional information on steps required to upgrade from existing versions to v4 is outlined in <a href=\"#attachmentb-2022x07x29\" target=\"_blank\">Attachment B</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Department is committed to ensuring the PMHC MDS supports all PHNs to collect and report their data consistently.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"attachmenta-2022x07x29\"></a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"attachment-a--key-changes-in-the-pmhc-mds-v4-specification\">Attachment A – Key changes in the PMHC MDS v4 specification</h5>\n\n<p>This section describes key changes in the v4 specification. Please note it is not an exhaustive list of all changes. A list of definitions for the v4 data model and specification is available at <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/data-model-and-specifications.html#definitions\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/data-model-and-specifications.html#definitions</a>.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"intake-record\">Intake record</h6>\n\n<p>The v4 specification introduces the concept of an intake that is modelled on the HeadtoHelp v3 specification. The intake record allows consistent collection and reporting on Intake and Initial Assessment and Referral (IAR) activity for all PHNs.</p>\n\n<p>The Referred to Organisation Path field has been introduced to capture which PHN provider organisation an intake team referred a client to.  Some intake services may refer a client to a PHN service across multiple PHN regions. To support collection of data for this field, PHNs should consider that their intake service providers may require access to a list of relevant Provider organisations’ Organisation Keys for PHN providers they may refer to.</p>\n\n<p>The intake record also includes Referral Date and Suicide Risk Flag fields in addition to existing fields in Episode record.  The Department recognises this may have implications for the calculation of the Suicide Risk follow up indicator in future. Currently, the calculation and data assessed for that indicator will not change for 2021-22 and 2022-23 performance reporting.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"funding-source\">Funding source</h6>\n\n<p>The v4 specification introduces a Funding Source field to be collected for each service contact. The Department is moving towards enabling reporting by funding stream. The introduction of this field is also a first step toward development of an efficiency indicator to support the development of key performance indicators for governments under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement.</p>\n\n<p>For the first 12 months the Department will analyse the new funding source data only for the purpose of understanding the application to, and relationship with, other data elements in the model, and possible reporting outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>The Department encourages PHNs to communicate appropriate and accurate use of the Funding Source field to service providers through their commissioning arrangements.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"program-type\">Program type</h6>\n\n<p>The introduction of the Program Type field allows PHNs and provider organisations to record the type of PHN mental health program that an episode is wholly or primarily delivered through. Combining this information with Funding Source supports improved visibility of integrated commissioning approaches to PHN mental health services.</p>\n\n<p>This is the hierarchy of variables that Logicly will use to map existing records to a Program Type category:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Any episodes with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">!covid19</code> tag will be mapped to “Head to Health”</li>\n  <li>Any unmapped episodes with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">!amhc</code> tag will be mapped to “AMHC”</li>\n  <li>Any unmapped episodes with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">!br20</code> tag will be mapped to “Bushfire Recovery”</li>\n  <li>Any unmapped episodes with Principal Focus of Treatment “Psychosocial” will be mapped to “Psychosocial”</li>\n  <li>Any remaining unmapped episodes will be mapped to “Flexible Funding Pool”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h6 id=\"practitioner-data\">Practitioner data</h6>\n\n<p>The v4 specification will allow PHNs and provider organisations to record multiple practitioners for a service contact. To support this, we have introduced an additional Service Contact Practitioner record.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"program-specific-considerations\">Program-specific considerations</h6>\n\n<p><strong>Head to Health</strong></p>\n\n<p>From 1 July 2022, all PHNs are required to collect and report intake data, including Intake Assessment and Referral (IAR) score, for the national Head to Health Phone Service. To support data collection requirements under this program, PHNs are encouraged to transition to the v4 specification as soon as possible after the release date.  Any PHNs using interim intake data collection and reporting arrangements should maintain these until they upgrade to v4.</p>\n\n<p><strong>National Psychosocial Support Services</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Continuity of Support (CoS) field will no longer be collected in the v4 specification. This follows the conclusion of the CoS funding and services on 30 June 2022.</p>\n\n<p>To date, psychosocial program data has been identified using the Principal Focus of Treatment Plan (PFOT) “Psychosocial” category. This PFOT category will no longer be collected in the v4 specification. Instead, PHNs and provider organisations can indicate an episode is delivered through the National Psychosocial Support Service scheme through the Program Type field.</p>\n\n<p>Psychosocial will still be a valid PFOT under existing versions of the PMHC MDS.</p>\n\n<p>Through planned migration, any historical or new records that utilise the Psychosocial PFOT will be mapped to this Program Type field under the v4 specification.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Way Back</strong></p>\n\n<p>Impacts to data upload requirements for The Way Back program to be compatible with v4 are being resolved between the Department and Logicly. For the time being, the existing upload arrangements can continue. The Department will provide further advice to PHNs regarding the use of v4 with The Way Back extension.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"attachmentb-2022x07x29\"></a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"attachment-b--steps-to-upgrade-from-existing-versions-to-v4\">Attachment B – Steps to upgrade from existing versions to v4</h5>\n\n<p>PMHC-MDS data entry interface will be updated to reflect the v4 specification and the HeadtoHelp components of the data entry interface will no longer be available.</p>\n\n<p>For a six-month period from the v4 release date, the PMHC-MDS will still be able to accept the following upload formats:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>v2</li>\n  <li>headspace v2 (only to be used by headspace National Office)</li>\n  <li>HeadtoHelp v3 extension</li>\n  <li>The Way Back Support Service v3 extension</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For technical support, please contact Logicly at <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a></p>\n\n<h6 id=\"version-2\">Version 2</h6>\n\n<p>To upgrade from v2 uploads to v4 uploads, PHNs must ensure that measure keys supplied in v4 uploads match measure keys already stored in uploads submitted PMHC MDS. For an explanation of the different options available please refer to steps required to upgrade from v2 to v4 uploads, available at <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/changes-from-v2.html#steps-required-to-upgrade\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/changes-from-v2.html#steps-required-to-upgrade</a>.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"migration-of-data-from-legacy-specifications\">Migration of data from legacy specifications</h6>\n\n<p>To effectively manage transition, data uploaded in existing versions and extensions will be instantly mapped to v4 when uploaded. For historical data, Logicly will conduct a point-in-time migration of stored v2 or v3 data to the new v4 format while rolling out the v4 release.</p>\n"

These issues will need to be addressed by 1st July 2022 to enable the transition to PMHC-MDS version 4 from 1 Aug 2022. The department has introduced a new data item to support affected PHNs to address the data quality issues.</li>\n  <li>Adjust the requirement for coding Principal Focus of Treatment (PFOT) for COVID-19 Head to Health and AMHC services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For technical support please contact Logicly via <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"1-head-to-health-extension\">1. Head to Health extension</h5>\n\n<p>The PMHC MDS-Head to Health (HtH) extension was developed to support PHN data collection of COVID-19 Head to Health ‘pop-up’ clinic activity in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory as part of the Australian Government’s response to the mental health impact of COVID-19. Currently, 14 PHNs are using the HtH extension.</p>\n\n<p>PHNs are currently expected to link data for clients that proceed from intake to receiving PHN mental health services.</p>\n\n<p>Action by the 14 participating PHNs is requested to be completed by 1st July 2022.  The department recognises this is an unplanned and time sensitive exercise that requires unexpected resourcing from the 14 PHNs and their service providers collecting HtH data.</p>\n\n<p>Technical instructions for participating PHNs are outlined in <a href=\"#attachmenta\" target=\"_blank\">Attachment A</a>. The department will work closely with Logicly and PHNs to support and guide this process.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"2-principal-focus-of-treatment-plan\">2. Principal focus of treatment plan</h5>\n\n<p>Previous guidance required PFOT to be coded as ‘other’ for COVID Head to Health services. The department has changed this rule and now requires PFOT to be coded according to the same definitions used for all other PHN commissioned mental health services.</p>\n\n<p>Action by PHNs is requested to be completed by 31 August 2022.  Technical instructions for participating PHNs are outlined in <a href=\"#attachmentb\" target=\"_blank\">Attachment B</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"attachmenta\"></a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"attachment-a--technical-guidance-head-to-health-pmhc-mds-extension\">Attachment A – Technical guidance: Head to Health PMHC MDS extension</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"current-issues\">Current issues</h6>\n\n<p>In preparing for the migration, data quality issues with the HtH extension have been identified that make the planned data migration unable to be completed. Interim changes are proposed to reduce the risk of misrepresenting Intake activity and Episode activity in PMHC-MDS data once it is migrated to v4. This also reduces the risk of activity counts being inaccurate and unreliable for reporting purposes. Going forward, the v4 specification resolves this as it adds an explicit Intake record.</p>\n\n<p>To effectively manage transition from current PMHC MDS specifications to v4, data uploaded in the HtH extension will be instantly mapped to v4. The department anticipates the release of v4 at the end of July 2022.  PHNs will receive additional information about v4 in June.</p>\n\n<p>The HtH extension uses episodes in two contexts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Intake context – includes intake information, Initial Assessment and Referral Decision Support Tool (IAR-DST) measure, but no other outcome measures or service contacts.</li>\n  <li>Hub context – includes full episode details, recorded service contacts, outcome measures, but no IAR-DST.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h6 id=\"overview-of-proposed-solution\">Overview of proposed solution</h6>\n\n<p>A solution to resolve current data quality issues with the HtH extension includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>introducing a ‘context’ field in the HtH extension specification that will be released 1 June 2022. The HtH hubs data specification at <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/</a> has been updated to reflect the new context field. The specification for the context field is defined at <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#dfn-context\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headtohelp/en/v3/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#dfn-context</a>.</li>\n  <li>retrospective data cleaning and population of the new ‘context’ field by the 14 participating PHNs and their providers currently collecting HtH extension data by 1st July 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h6 id=\"completion-of-new-context-field-for-all-episodes\">Completion of new context field for all episodes</h6>\n\n<p>The department requires that the below steps are actioned by each of the 14 participating PHNs by no later than by 1st July 2022.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Logicly will release the context field to production on 3 June 2022 and set the value of the context field for existing episodes as per the rules outlined below.</li>\n  <li>Between 3 June 2022 and 1 July 2022, all organisations owning data utilising the Head to Health (HtH) extension are required to review all of their data and ensure that the context field is correctly set unless the data is otherwise able to be rectified and clearly identified as Intake context or Episode context without use of the new Context field.</li>\n  <li>The context field will be used to migrate existing episodes that represent intakes into actual v4 Intake records. It is therefore important that this information is correct.</li>\n  <li>When performing the v4 migration any episodes where the context is still set to ‘Unknown’ will remain as episodes and their context will still be set to ‘Unknown’. If any of these records are later determined to be Intake records they will need to be deleted and re-added as an Intake.</li>\n  <li>For any organisations wishing to review their data prior to 1 June 2022, please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> to request a breakdown of episode keys and the context to which they will be mapped.</li>\n  <li>Please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> with any other questions or requests for assistance.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h6 id=\"rules-for-classifying-intake-and-hub-episodes\">Rules for classifying Intake and Hub Episodes</h6>\n\n<p>The context field on existing records will be set according to the following rules. The order of these rules is important. Note that all elements in a set of dot points must apply except where they are explicitly separated by an “or”.</p>\n\n<p>A HtH episode will be mapped to an Intake context when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>It has a linked HtH Episode</li>\n  <li>HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key are both null</li>\n  <li>There are no Service Contacts linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>There is an IAR-DST linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>There are no other measures linked to the episode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A HtH episode will be mapped to Hub context with linkage to an existing HtH episode with Intake context when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>There are Service Contacts linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>There is no IAR-DST linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key both contain valid values to records that exist in the PMHC MDS and does not link to itself</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A HtH episode will be mapped to a Hub context without linkage to an existing HtH episode with Intake context when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>There are Service Contacts linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>There is no IAR-DST linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>One or both of HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key contain valid values</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>There are no Service Contacts linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>There is no IAR-DST linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>One or both of HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key contain valid values</li>\n  <li>There are non IAR-DST measures linked to the episode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>There are Service Contacts linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key are both null</li>\n  <li>There is no IAR-DST linked to the episode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A HtH episode will be split and mapped to both a HtH Intake context episode and a linked HtH Hub context episode when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>There are Service Contacts linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>There is an IAR-DST linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key both contain valid values</li>\n  <li>HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key attempts to link to records that do not exist in the PMHC MDS or links to itself</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A HtH episode will be mapped to Hub context with linkage to an existing HtH episode with Intake context when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>There are no Service Contacts linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>There is no IAR-DST linked to the episode</li>\n  <li>HtH Episode - Intake Organisation Path and HtH Episode - Intake Episode Key both contain valid values to records that exist in the PMHC MDS and does not link to itself</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Otherwise, the context of the HtH episode will be set to ‘Unknown’.</p>\n\n<p>Following this:</p>\n\n<p>Organisations that are clearly operating as “Hub only” (all HtH episodes map to Hub or Unknown using the above rules) will have the context of all their HtH episodes set to Hub.</p>\n\n<p>Organisations that are clearly operating as “Intake only” (all HtH episodes map to Intake or Unknown using the above rules) will have the context of all their HtH episodes set to Intake.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"attachmentb\"></a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"attachment-b--technical-guidance-principal-focus-of-treatment\">Attachment B – Technical guidance: Principal focus of treatment</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"current-issues-1\">Current issues</h6>\n\n<p>Previous definitions on the PMHC-MDS website advised that HtH pop up episodes should use the principal focus of treatment plan (PFOT) ‘Other’.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"overview-of-proposed-solution-1\">Overview of proposed solution</h6>\n\n<p>To manage data entry at intake (where PFOT may not yet be determined), the department has updated the definition so that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Other’ should only be selected for intake episodes and\nPFOT to be coded according to the same definitions used for all other PHN commissioned mental health services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"actions-required-by-phns\">Actions required by PHNs</h5>\n\n<p>Where PHNs have used the ‘Other’ PFOT for HtH pop up or Adult Mental Health Centre (AMHC) episodes, the department requests PHNs amend all historical HtH or AMHC program data to reflect the most appropriate PFOT (e.g. Psychological therapies or low intensity etc) by 31 August 2022.</p>\n"

		"title": "FOR INFORMATION&#58; June 1 2022 release of the Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS)",
		"date": "May 25, 2022",
		"content": "<p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs on Wednesday 25 May 2022.</p>\n\n<p>-----------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>PHN CEO Circular 2022/01 – May 2022</strong></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"online-measures-self-service-system-omsss\">Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS)</h4>\n\n<p>This paper outlines the release of the Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS), and how it can be used to collect outcome measures for clients of Primary Health Network (PHN) commissioned mental health services. This system is available for all PHN commissioned services to use from 1 June 2022. PHNs are not required to use the OMSSS – it is an optional tool available to PHNs to support the collection of outcome measures for clinical care and service improvement.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"1-overview\">1. Overview</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"11-what-is-the-online-measures-self-service-system-omsss\">1.1. What is the Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS)?</h6>\n\n<p>The OMSSS is an online service funded by the Australian Government Department of Health (the department) as part of the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS). It allows clients of PHN-commissioned mental health services to complete the standardised outcome measures mandated in the PMHC MDS and have the results reported back to their service providers.</p>\n\n<p>The OMSSS offers flexibility in the way that outcome measures are collected, making it more accessible to service consumers who will be able to complete the information on their own devices, at a time that suits them. The system can replace the current ‘paper and pencil’ systems in place in many organisations. It is also adaptable to the existing processes of each provider organisation, integrating with a range of local third-party client information management systems (CIMS) via an Application Programming Interface (API). More information is available at the OMSSS REST API website: <a href=\"https://api.omsss.online/\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.omsss.online/</a></p>\n\n<p>Subject to the permitted uses described below, the OMSSS can be used by PHNs and their commissioned provider organisations to collect any of the following outcome measures mandated in the PMHC MDS: Kessler 5 (K5), Kessler 10 Plus (K10+), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Additionally, the YES PHN survey can be collected through the OMSSS. Information about these measures can be found at: <a href=\"https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/</a></p>\n\n<h6 id=\"12-how-does-omsss-work\">1.2. How does OMSSS work?</h6>\n\n<p>The OMSSS is accessed by clients of PHN-commissioned mental health services and used to enter outcome measures, for example the Kessler-10 Plus (K10+). The item scores are automatically totalled and made available to the PMHC MDS or the provider’s CIMS. It should be noted that the item scores and totals will only be uploaded into a provider’s CIMS if the CIMS have been integrated with the OMSSS using the API. The information can also be provided in a report to the relevant service provider. This automation reduces the administrative workload of clinical staff and minimises the chance of errors.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"14-features-and-benefits\">1.4. Features and benefits</h6>\n\n<p>Regular monitoring by service providers of client outcomes using standardised measures is critical to informing treatment decisions and ongoing dialogue between service providers and their clients. Reporting on client outcomes is a fundamental requirement of the PMHC MDS, and the OMSSS has been developed to support regular collection with the following features and benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Enables clients to complete measures in their own time and on their own device which may\nimprove completion rates</li>\n  <li>Provide greater insight into clients’ progress and the efficacy of treatments</li>\n  <li>Flexibility for the OMSSS to be implemented in a way that suits the provider’s\nways of working and preferred approach to client completion of measures</li>\n  <li>Flexibility regarding the treatment of completed questionnaires. Subscales\ncan be uploaded to the PMHC MDS, the provider’s own CIMS (if integrated\nwith the OMSSS using the API), and reports can be emailed directly to the\nrelevant practitioner</li>\n  <li>Significant reduction in data entry for staff, and</li>\n  <li>Automated scoring and integration with the PMHC MDS / CIMS reduce the risk\nof data entry and scoring errors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"licensing-arrangements-and-permitted-use\">Licensing arrangements and permitted use</h5>\n\n<p>PHNs and their commissioned Provider Organisations can use the OMSSS to collect the mandated outcome measures free of charge when the service provided to the client has been commissioned by the relevant PHN. At this stage, no other use of the OMSSS is permitted. A wider application of OMSSS in primary mental health care may be considered in the future.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"21-k10-and-k5\">2.1. K10+ and K5</h6>\n\n<p>Both the K10+ and K5 measures are in the public domain and may be used freely provided the author is properly referenced. Each of these measures is used widely throughout Australia with no restrictions on their incorporation in electronic data collection systems.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"22-sdq\">2.2. SDQ</h6>\n\n<p>The SDQ measures, authored by Dr Robert Goodman, are copyright protected with the UK-based Youthinmind organisation (<a href=\"https://youthinmind.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://youthinmind.com/</a>). Specific conditions are attached to use of the SDQ measures, detailed at <a href=\"https://sdqinfo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://sdqinfo.org/</a>. These include the requirement that no modifications are made to the content in any way. Paper versions may be downloaded and copied without charge, subject to adherence to this condition.</p>\n\n<p>The Australian Government Department of Health has entered into a licence agreement with Youthinmind to enable inclusion of the SDQ measures within the OMSSS. This enables PHNs and commissioned providers to use the electronic data collection, scoring and upload arrangements but only in the context of delivery of mental health care services that have been commissioned by PHNs. Further details in relation to licensed uses are described below.</p>\n\n<p>The department is aware of a range of proprietary CIMS are in use by private practising providers and organisations in Australia. Any licensing agreement for use of the SDQ within these systems for purposes other than PMHC MDS collection and reporting is a matter that must be separately negotiated between the software owners and Youthinmind. Additionally, the department is aware that many individual Australian mental health practitioners make use of the functionality offered by Youthinmind, including MySDQ, SDQPlus and SDQScore. Responsibility for ensuring compliance with Youthinmind requirements for each of these functions rests with the individual practitioners and their parent organisations.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"3-yes-phn\">3. YES PHN</h5>\n\n<p>The YES PHN survey has now been included into the PMHC MDS data model and into the OMSSS. YES PHN data is not linked to client or episode records to adhere with the protocol for use and implementation of the YES PHN survey outlined in the guidance (available at <a href=\"https://www.amhocn.org/your-experience-service-surveys\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.amhocn.org/your-experience-service-surveys/</a>). This includes assurance to the client that the results are anonymous and administering organisations will not be able to identify both if their client has completed a YES PHN survey, or their scores.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"4-data-security-and-privacy\">4. Data Security and Privacy</h5>\n\n<p>Client privacy is critical. It is the responsibility of PHNs, service providers, and the department to ensure client information is managed appropriately and in accordance with respective obligations under legislation and the Australian Privacy Principles. Personal information of clients, and the results of their measures will be sent only to their health care provider. All entered data are communicated and stored in compliance with Australian privacy and data security legislation. This includes encrypting all information in transit and ensuring that only appropriate and approved people have access to that information.</p>\n\n<p>The collection of client measures through the OMSSS as implemented by the PMHC MDS complies with the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles. Organisations utilising the OMSSS API to collect measures directly are responsible for ensuring appropriate privacy requirements are complied with.</p>\n\n<p>Information is stored in OMSSS only while it is in use and for a limited time. Collection data can only be submitted up to 7 days after the record has been created and after a collection has been submitted. The results are only stored for a maximum of 7 days. All data except logs are automatically deleted after a period of 7 days, and can also be deleted earlier at the request of the integrator. Results pertaining to deleted data will be inaccessible after deletion, and the retained logs do not contain any personally identifying information.</p>\n\n<p>For more about client consent and privacy, please visit <a href=\"https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.omsss.online/en/latest/data-security-privacy.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.omsss.online/en/latest/data-security-privacy.html</a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"attachment-a---guidance-on-information-for-clients\">Attachment A - Guidance on Information for clients</h5>\n\n<p>It is essential that clients are told about the reasons for the request and who the information is being requested by prior to receiving a request to complete an outcome measure through the OMSSS. When a collection is requested through the PMHC MDS, or a client email or SMS is provided to OMSSS when using the OMSSS API, the following wording will be used in the invitation that is sent to the client. Where a client email or SMS is not provided via the OMSSS API, the Department suggests the wording below as a basis for PHNs to use, or promote to commissioned providers to use, in informing clients. PHNs and service providers may vary the wording to suit their requirements, or embed them in existing client information documents they have prepared locally. The wording differs slightly depending on whether the measure selected is to be completed by the client about themselves (the K10+ and K5, SDQ for youth) or whether it completed by parents/guardians in respect of children under their care (SDQ for children).</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"suggested-wording-for-email-invitations-to-complete-k-10-k-5-sdq-youth-version\">Suggested wording for email invitations to complete K-10+, K-5, SDQ youth version</h6>\n\n<p><em>As part of receiving services, &#60;Practitioner name&#62; is inviting you to complete a brief questionnaire at &#60;OMSSS link&#62; about aspects of your current mental wellbeing.

If\nany item has not been completed (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\nit is excluded from the total with the proviso that a completed K10 with more\nthan one missing item is regarded as invalid.</p>\n\n<p>Using this algorithm, a K10+ with one item missing and all other items scored\nas 1 will be regarded as valid and have a total score of 9, however the K10+\nTotal Score is defined as being in the range 10-50.</p>\n\n<p>To resolve this issue, the scoring for the K10+ will be changed to a\npro-rated approach so that the minimum total score is 10. The following\nformula will be used:</p>\n\n<p>Total score = round( sum of valid scores  / 9 * 10 )</p>\n\n<p>For more information please refer to page 58 of AMHOCN’s Overview of\nclinician-rated and consumer self-report measures at <a href=\"https://www.amhocn.org/sites/default/files/publication_files/nocc_clinician_and_self-report_measures_overview_v2.1_20210913_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.amhocn.org/sites/default/files/publication_files/nocc_clinician_and_self-report_measures_overview_v2.1_20210913_1.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Uploads that provide both the item scores and the total score will need to be\nupdated to use the new algorithm. Alternatively, uploads could be updated to\nprovide item scores and a total score of 99. Where item scores are provided\nwith a total of 99 the PMHC MDS will calculate the total score.</p>\n\n<p>Where item scores have been provided, existing data will be recalculated to\nuse the new scoring.</p>\n"

The data available will be from the period 2019-20.</p>\n\n<p>The department has been working with headspace National (hN) and Strategic\nData to identify a technical solution to include hAPI data into the PMHC MDS.\nThe technical solution has been designed with the intent that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>headspace National will upload consented data to the PMHC-MDS on behalf of\nall headspace centres</li>\n  <li>PHNs will be able to view aggregate data and download consented unit record\ndata for the services they commission from headspace centres</li>\n  <li>The department will be able to view aggregate data and download consented\nunit record data for all headspace centres</li>\n  <li>Local headspace centres will be able to view aggregate data and download\nconsented unit record data for their activity</li>\n  <li>Data will be uploaded quarterly <strong>and will be available within a month of the\nquarter’s completion</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This circular outlines the key technical issues to consider when using\nheadspace data.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"access-to-and-use-of-hapi-data\">Access to and use of hAPI data</h6>\n\n<p>The PMHC MDS concept of an episode requires that all service contacts and\ncollection occasions for an episode must occur at the same provider\norganisation. In the headspace context, this would mean that all occasions of\nservice for any single episode would have to be delivered at a single\nheadspace centre.</p>\n\n<p>headspace has a different episode model that allows episodes to span multiple\nprovider organisations and even multiple PHNs (primarily through the\nintroduction of satellite centres). In order to support the headspace model,\nthe <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headspace/en/v2/\" target=\"_blank\">PMHC MDS headspace specification</a> was designed to allow for\nservice contacts and collection occasions to be provided by a different\norganisation to the organisation that initiated the episode.</p>\n\n<p>The hAPI data is being made available in the PMHC MDS to support the\ndepartment, PHNs, hN and headspace centres in their role of monitoring and\nreporting on delivery of primary mental health care.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"hapi-data-in-pmhc-mds\">hAPI data in PMHC MDS</h6>\n\n<p>There are a number of important factors to consider when reviewing hAPI data in the PMHC-MDS:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>hAPI data in the PMHC MDS <strong>only</strong> includes consented records. Therefore,\na report drawn from the PMHC MDS will likely differ from the quarterly\nactivity reports provided by headspace National or the headspace Tableau\ndashboards which include all records as they are reported at an aggregate\ncentre and/or PHN level rather than at the individual level. Similarly,\nany report directly sourced from a headspace centre may also differ if\nthey have included all records in their report.</p>\n\n    <p>The headspace reports in tableau will continue to be available to PHNs and\nwill provide a full aggregated picture of activity at headspace centres.</p>\n\n    <p>For information regarding consent please refer to the headspace extranet\n – ourspace, at <a href=\"https://headspaceaus.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/ourspace/resources/hapi/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Documents/Primary/hAPI%202.0%20Consent%20Text%20V2.0.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=gXgkr2\" target=\"_blank\">https://headspaceaus.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/ourspace/resources/hapi/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Documents/Primary/hAPI%202.0%20Consent%20Text%20V2.0.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=gXgkr2</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>All data for an episode of care that has been delivered across multiple\nheadspace centres have been excluded from reports and data extracts. These\nepisodes represent a relatively small proportion of the total headspace\nepisodes (approximately 1%), however a limited number of centres and PHNs\nwill be more affected than others (particularly those with linked satellite\nservices). The Department will issue separate comms to the affected PHNs.\nThe Department is undertaking a review of the PMHC MDS episode model in\n2021 to try and address this issue. In the meantime a new report has been\ncreated, exclusively for hAPI data, that summarises the data excluded\nbecause it is part of an episode delivered across multiple centres (report\nA12, described below).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The Category A-C PMHC-MDS standard reports have been modified to allow for\nheadspace specific reports. The Category D: Key Performance Indicators and\nCategory E: Reports for data managers to monitor data supply series have\nnot been modified as they are not pertinent for headspace. The A5 and B3\nreports have had an extra ‘Funding Source’ selector added when viewing\nheadspace data. Two new reports have been added – an A12 – Episodes shared\nacross multiple organisations and B7 – Activity Report – hAPI Funding\nSource. Details about all reports are available at <a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html</a> has\nbeen updated to include headspace reports.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h6 id=\"recording-headspace-centre-activity\">Recording headspace centre activity</h6>\n\n<p>With the availability of headspace centre data in the PMHC MDS, hAPI is the data\ncollection vehicle for all activity delivered in a headspace centre,\nincluding services such as youth severe. As such, headspace centres will not\nbe required to submit data directly to the PMHC MDS for any activities\nincluding those funded outside the core headspace contract. This is to\nensure headspace centres can meet their obligations and to avoid duplication\nof records within the PMHC-MDS.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"headspace-centres\">headspace centres</h6>\n\n<p>headspace centres will be able to view reports but will not be able to read or\nedit the unit record level data in the PMHC MDS system – only hN will have\nthat capacity. headspace centres will be able to download a version of their\nown data at the unit record level to use for their own local purposes (e.g.\ninto spreadsheets for analysis, etc).</p>\n\n<p>hN will liaise with Strategic Data for each of the headspace centres to gain\naccess to the PMHC MDS to view reports for their activity.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed specifications can be found on the PMHC MDS website\n<a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headspace/en/v2/\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-headspace/en/v2/</a></p>\n\n<p>The Reports User Guide on the PMHC-MDS website at\n<a href=\"https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html</a> has been updated to include headspace\nreports.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h6>\n\n<p>If you have any questions, please contact\nGeneral PMHC MDS – Strategic Data <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>, (03) 9340 9000</p>\n\n<p>hAPI collection – headspace National <a href=\"mailto:support@headspace.org.au\">support@headspace.org.au</a></p>\n\n<p>headspace Tableau reporting – headspace National <a href=\"mailto:datareporting@headspace.org.au\">datareporting@headspace.org.au</a></p>\n\n<p>Other queries?

The following provides CEOs an update on the transition to full compliance and the master client index.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"transition-to-full-compliance\">Transition to Full Compliance</h4>\n\n<p>Previous communications have indicated that the existing Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) / Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) MDS would be shut down when the PMHC MDS data entry interface was implemented. Due to difficulties in converting the data between the two systems, the ATAPS/MHSRA system will continue until further notice.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 July 2017, full compliance with the PMHC MDS is still expected. However, this means all consenting clients referred for mental health services from 1 July 2017 have information entered into the PMHC MDS. Existing clients whose data has been entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS may continue to do so. However, new referrals should NOT be entered into the ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS from 1 July 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Options for reporting and transferring active ATAPS referrals into the new PMHC MDS have been considered by the PMHC MDS Working Group and three options have been agreed for addressing the needs. Each PHN must choose only one option, their preferred option, of the three presented below.</p>\n\n<p>Once selected, please have your PMHC MDS Data Primary User advise your preferred option to Strategic Data at <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 1 July 2017. Strategic Data will then work with the PHN on their preferred option.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"option-one\">Option one</h5>\n\n<p>The ATAPS / MHSRRA MDS will be kept online for up to 12 months to allow for those existing client referrals already receiving services under the old ‘ATAPS’ system to be maintained until all sessions associated with that referral are complete.</p>\n\n<p>This option requires PHNs and their organisations to work with two data collections, ie: The PMHC MDS for new clients / episodes commencing post 1 July 2017 and the old ATAPS system for existing clients who have not completed their treatment.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"option-two\">Option two</h5>\n\n<p>Strategic Data will provide the PHN an <em>ATAPS MDS data extract in PMHC MDS upload format</em>. The extract will contain ATAPS clients and their associated data where a client had an associated session in the last 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>Note that, ATAPS does not associate clients with provider organisations, which is a structural element required for the PMHC MDS. Therefore, the organisation path in this extract will be empty and the PHN will need to assign each client to their correct provider organisation. Any other data which cannot be mapped from ATAPS to PMHC data definitions will be set as missing. Each record will have the ‘!ATAPS’ tag added so records exported from ATAPS can be identified in future analysis.</p>\n\n<p>This option will require significant work by the PHN to assign provider organisations to each client and significant amounts of missing data on the migrated clients.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"option-three\">Option three</h5>\n\n<p>Where PHNs are implementing new clients systems, they may choose to map the ATAPS data to PMHC data and then upload to the PMHC MDS directly from their client system. PHNs choosing this option will be provided with specifications of the <em>mapping of ATAPS to PMHC format</em> being used to produce the ATAPS MDS data extract at option two. This option requires PHNs to follow this mapping format to provide consistency in mapped ATAPS data.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"master-client-index\">Master Client Index</h4>\n\n<p>The current PMHC MDS specification requires a Client Key that is unique and stable at the PHN regional level, not at the provider organisation level. The purpose of the Master Client Index is to help PHNs and their provider organisations manage client information across the PHN region. This requirement has proven problematic for PHNs and is being worked through by the PMHC MDS Working Group.</p>\n\n<p>To determine what issues exist with managing the client key and possible solutions, nine PHNs worked with Strategic Data to describe their models for triaging patients, the information systems being used by PHNs and provider organisations, the ease of updating information systems and resources available for manual reconciliation of clients.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of this work, a Master Client Index is not possible at this time, and as such, will not be a requirement for full compliance from 1 July 2017. The requirement will now be organisational uniqueness instead of regional level uniqueness until this can be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>The PMHC Working Group agrees that the opportunity for national and regional level uniqueness is an aspiration and will continue to be investigated by the Department. The Department is currently looking into the use of Healthcare Identifiers and will provide you with updates as this work progresses.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any further queries, please email: <a href=\"mailto:mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au\">mentalhealthdata@health.gov.au</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n\n<p>Mental Health Data and Funding Section<br />\nMental Health Services Branch<br />\nHealth Services Division<br />\nDepartment of Health</p>\n"

		"content": "<p>Stage 2 development of the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS)  is currently underway. A requirement of the PMHC MDS is that a client key must be unique within each Primary Health Network (PHN) independent of the treating organisation. It is the responsibility of PHNs and Provider Organisations to co-ordinate to maintain this identifier. Clients should not be assigned multiple keys within the same PHN.</p>\n\n<p>In order to help maintain the client key, a component of Stage 2 is to develop a Master Client Index (MCI). It is envisaged that Provider Organisations will be able to access the MCI in order to locate existing clients at other Provider Organisations with the same PHN and match the client key, or create a new client if the client does not yet exist in the MCI.</p>\n\n<p>In order to ensure that the MCI meets the needs of PHNs and Provider Organisations we would like to discuss the requirements with a volunteer group of PHNs and their Provider Organisations. These discussions would take the form of teleconferences and possibly one on one phone calls.</p>\n\n<p>Organisations who are willing to volunteer are requested to email <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by 7 April 2017.</p>\n"

Prior to this we are looking for between 5 and 10 PHNs to volunteer as early adopters. These PHNs will commence upload from the 7th of November, and help us to streamline the system prior to making it available to all PHNs from the beginning of December.</p>\n\n<p>We would like some of the early adopters to be uploading zipped csv files and some to be uploading Excel spreadsheets. They will need to be willing to provide feedback on the process used to give the primary contact user access to the system, the usability of the system, and the documentation and training.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits of moving to the PMHC include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Early access to features which are not included in the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS:</li>\n  <li>Partitioning of provider organisations within a PHN so that provider organisations can only access their own data.</li>\n  <li>Delegation of user management to each provider organisation.</li>\n  <li>Reduced data collection burden due to not needing to collect data items that have been retired from the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please email <a href=\"mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com?Subject=PMHC%20MDS%20Request%20for%20early%20adopters\">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> by Friday the 28th of October, 2016 if you would like to volunteer. PHNs who have been selected to be early adopters will be notified on Wednesday the 2nd of November, 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally there are still a few PHNs who have not yet submitted a ‘Letter of Authority’ it would be appreciated if you could address this as a matter of priority. If you are unsure we will be following up with individual PHN’s in the next two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n\n<p>Mental Health Data and Funding Section<br />\nMental Health Services Branch<br />\nHealth Services Division<br />\nDepartment of Health</p>\n"

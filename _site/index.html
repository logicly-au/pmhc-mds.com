          <p>Funding by the Australian Government Department of Health has been provided to
Primary Health Networks (PHNs) through a Primary Mental Health Care flexible
funding pool to support commissioning of mental health and suicide prevention
services in six key service delivery areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low intensity psychological interventions for people with, or at risk of,
mild mental illness;</li>
  <li>psychological therapies delivered by mental health professionals to under
serviced groups;</li>
  <li>early intervention services for children and young people with, or at risk of
mental illness;</li>
  <li>services for people with severe and complex mental illness who are being
managed in a primary care setting;</li>
  <li>enhanced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health services; and</li>
  <li>a regional approach to suicide prevention activities with a focus on improved
follow-up for people who have attempted suicide or are at high risk of suicide.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will provide the
basis for PHNs and the Department of Health to monitor and report on the quantity and quality of service delivery, and to inform future improvements in the planning and funding of primary mental health care services funded by the Australian Government.</p>

<p>The data reported by PHNs through the PMHC MDS will form the basis for
production of key performance indicators used to monitor services delivered
across the 31 PHN regions covered by PHNs.</p>

<p><a href="//logicly.com.au/">Logicly</a> has been contracted by the Department of Health to manage the PMHC MDS on its behalf.</p>

<p>A <a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specifications.html">specification</a> of the data items to be collected in the PMHC MDS is available.</p>

<p>If you would like to be notified about updates to this specification or
announcements about the rollout of the PMHC MDS please subscribe to the
PMHC MDS mailing list by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com?subject=subscribe%20news">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> with the subject “subscribe news@lists.pmhc-mds.com”. This is not a general discussion list. Only moderated users can send
messages to this list.</p>

<p>Information about <a href="/getstarted/">how to get started</a> on the PMHC MDS is available and will be regularly updated.</p>

      <p>You may have seen a recent PMHC MDS notification that users from State 
and Territory Governments will now be given access to aggregate PMHC MDS 
reports. We wish to advise that this only means that the technical data 
systems of the PMHC MDS have been updated in order to allow for access to be 
granted. Sharing of the PMHC MDS with State and Territory Governments as per 
commitments under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement 
is being closely managed by the Department of Health and Aged Care and access 
will only be granted after the relevant State or Territory health 
department/agency has signed a Data Sharing Agreement and agreed to follow a 
Data Access Protocol. These documents describe roles and responsibilities for 
specific users within a State or Territory health department/agency to ensure 
PMHC MDS data is handled appropriately and safely. Further information will 
be provided by the Department in due course.</p>

<h4 id="pmhc-mds-update-v2128">PMHC MDS Update v2.12.8</h4>

<p>We are pleased to announce that PMHC MDS Update v2.12.8 was released on July 30, 2024.</p>

<p>The following updates have been applied in the reporting interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug where reports using The Wayback data source returned the error 
message ‘An error occurred: bad report data source’</li>
</ul>

<p>The user guides have been updated to reflect these updates. They are available
at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/</a>.</p>

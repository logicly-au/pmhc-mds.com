          <p>Funding by the Australian Government Department of Health has been provided to
Primary Health Networks (PHNs) through a Primary Mental Health Care flexible
funding pool to support commissioning of mental health and suicide prevention
services in six key service delivery areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low intensity psychological interventions for people with, or at risk of,
mild mental illness;</li>
  <li>psychological therapies delivered by mental health professionals to under
serviced groups;</li>
  <li>early intervention services for children and young people with, or at risk of
mental illness;</li>
  <li>services for people with severe and complex mental illness who are being
managed in a primary care setting;</li>
  <li>enhanced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health services; and</li>
  <li>a regional approach to suicide prevention activities with a focus on improved
follow-up for people who have attempted suicide or are at high risk of suicide.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will provide the
basis for PHNs and the Department of Health to monitor and report on the quantity and quality of service delivery, and to inform future improvements in the planning and funding of primary mental health care services funded by the Australian Government.</p>

<p>The data reported by PHNs through the PMHC MDS will form the basis for
production of key performance indicators used to monitor services delivered
across the 31 PHN regions covered by PHNs.</p>

<p><a href="//logicly.com.au/">Logicly</a> has been contracted by the Department of Health to manage the PMHC MDS on its behalf.</p>

<p>A <a href="//docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specifications.html">specification</a> of the data items to be collected in the PMHC MDS is available.</p>

<p>If you would like to be notified about updates to this specification or
announcements about the rollout of the PMHC MDS please subscribe to the
PMHC MDS mailing list by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com?subject=subscribe%20news">support@pmhc-mds.com</a> with the subject “subscribe news@lists.pmhc-mds.com”. This is not a general discussion list. Only moderated users can send

<h5 id="background-2025x11x19">Background</h5>

<p>As outlined in the August 2025 circular to PHNs, the PMHC MDS is undergoing a series of
enhancements to ensure data collection and reporting remain consistent with the evolving
landscape of national mental health programs. The August circular introduced the planned
rebranding of The Way Back Support Service (TWBSS) to Universal Aftercare, as well as the
changes from AMHC and Head to Health to Medicare Mental Health Centres (MMHCs). The
PMHC MDS Version 5.0 data specification release provides further refinements to Program
Types, Funding Sources, and reporting processes to support improved monitoring and
evaluation of these services.</p>

<h5 id="pmhc-mds-version-50-data-specification">PMHC MDS Version 5.0 Data Specification</h5>

<p>The PMHC MDS Version 5.0 Data Specification is now available at <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v5.0/" target="_blank">https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v5.0/</a>.</p>

<h5 id="key-changes-in-version-50">Key Changes in Version 5.0</h5>

<p>Version 5.0 completes the rebranding to MMHC and Universal Aftercare. It includes the
following changes:</p>

<h6 id="universal-aftercare-2025x11x19">Universal Aftercare</h6>

<ul>
  <li>A ‘9: Universal Aftercare’ response will be added to the Program Type field on both the
Intake and Episode tables. This means that Universal Aftercare data will now be
triggered by the Program Type, not by a tag.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Seven entirely new tables will be added corresponding to the existing tables in the
Wayback extension. These tables will only need to be submitted where Episodes using
the new ‘9: Universal Aftercare’ Program Type are included</p>

    <ul>
      <li>UA Episode</li>
      <li>UA Recommendation Out</li>
      <li>UA Critical Incident</li>
      <li>UA Plan</li>
      <li>UA Needs Identification (NI)</li>
      <li>SIDAS</li>
      <li>WHO-5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Existing episodes tagged with !wayback will be migrated to the new Universal Aftercare
Program Type. The !wayback tag will be retained for historical reference only.</li>
  <li>A new system tag (!uaooh) will be introduced to distinguish episodes under the
Universal Aftercare Outside of Hospital/Expanded Referral Pathway Trial. The !uaooh
tag will only be allowed on Episode records where the Program Type is ‘9: Universal
Aftercare’. This tag should be applied to all episodes delivered under the Universal
Aftercare Outside of Hospital/Expanded Referral Pathway Trial.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing Way Back-specific reports (W1-W4) will be retired and replaced with
updated reports in the standard reports tab:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The W1 report will be converted from a downloadable Excel template to a CSV format.</li>
      <li>The W2 report will be retired and a new A series report implemented that shows
the number of episodes that have the Universal Aftercare Program Type but no
linked UA Episode record.</li>
      <li>The W3 report that reports on missing TWB Extension data will be converted to a
standard report.</li>
      <li>The W4 report that reports on Needs Identification and Recommendation Out
data will be converted to a standard report.</li>
      <li>The Data Source selector will be updated to remove ‘The Way Back’ and add
‘Universal Aftercare’, based on the new Program Type.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SIDAS and WHO-5 outcome measures will continue to require individual item score
reporting, consistent with previous TWB standards and to support data quality validation.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="medicare-mental-health-centres">Medicare Mental Health Centres</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The following changes will be applied to the Program Type field on both the Intake and
Episode tables:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>‘2: Head to Health’ renamed to ‘2: Head to Health Clinic’. This response is only
to be used by remaining Head to Health Clinics in New South Wales and Victoria.</li>
      <li>‘3: AMHC’ will be retired. An error will be returned if this response is used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Existing episodes with Program Type ‘3: AMHC’ will be migrated to Program Type ‘8:MMHC’.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing episodes with Program Type ‘2: Head to Health’ will be migrated to Program
Type ‘8: MMHC’, excluding:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Former Pop-Up clinics and Head to Health clinics in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory</li>
      <li>Continuing Head to Health clinics in New South Wales</li>
      <li>Existing/former Pop-Up clinics and Head to Health clinics in Victoria except for the Geelong MMHC</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="other">Other</h6>

<ul>
  <li>A new Veteran field will be added to the Intake and Episode tables. This field was
included in The Way Back specification. There is a new IAR-DST variant in development
for Veterans. Veterans will be included on the Intake and Episode tables instead of the
new UA Episode table so that it can be used for monitoring both the IAR-DST and
Universal Aftercare.</li>
  <li>A new IAR-DST - Practitioner Reason for Override will be added to the IAR-DST table.</li>
  <li>A New report will allow SDQ, K10/K5, WHO-5, and SIDAS to be reported consistently
across all program types.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="transition-period">Transition Period</h5>

<p>A six-month transition period will be allowed during which the PMHC MDS Version 4.1, The Way
Back Version 3.0 and PMHC MDS Version 5.0 data specifications will all be accepted. After this
transition period, the PMHC MDS Version 4.1 and The Way Back Version 3.0 data specifications
will no longer be able to be uploaded to the PMHC MDS. During the transition period any data
uploaded under either the PMHC MDS Version 4.1 or The Way Back Version 3.0 data
specifications will be migrated to PMHC MDS Version 5.0 data specification.</p>

<h5 id="pmhc-mds-version-50-data-specification-release">PMHC MDS Version 5.0 data specification release</h5>

<p>Implementation of the PMHC MDS Version 5.0 data specification is currently being finalised
and undergoing quality assurance testing. Logicly will provide information about a release date
via the PMHC MDS mailing list. If you would like to be added to the mailing list, please email
<a href="mailto:support@pmhc-mds.com">support@pmhc-mds.com</a>.</p>

<h5 id="action-required-2025x11x19">Action required</h5>

<p>PHNs and their service providers must ensure all relevant staff review this circular and prepare
for the transition to Version 5.0. This includes updating systems and processes to
accommodate the changes. Both Version 5.0 and existing Version 4.1 specifications will be
accepted for a 6-month transition period, after which only Version 5.0 uploads will be
permitted.</p>

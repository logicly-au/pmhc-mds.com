<p><strong>PHN CEO Circular 2022/01 – May 2022</strong></p>

<h4 id="online-measures-self-service-system-omsss">Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS)</h4>

<p>This paper outlines the release of the Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS), and how it can be used to collect outcome measures for clients of Primary Health Network (PHN) commissioned mental health services. This system is available for all PHN commissioned services to use from 1 June 2022. PHNs are not required to use the OMSSS – it is an optional tool available to PHNs to support the collection of outcome measures for clinical care and service improvement.</p>

<h5 id="1-overview">1. Overview</h5>

<h6 id="11-what-is-the-online-measures-self-service-system-omsss">1.1. What is the Online Measures Self Service System (OMSSS)?</h6>

<p>The OMSSS is an online service funded by the Australian Government Department of Health (the department) as part of the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS). It allows clients of PHN-commissioned mental health services to complete the standardised outcome measures mandated in the PMHC MDS and have the results reported back to their service providers.</p>

<p>The OMSSS offers flexibility in the way that outcome measures are collected, making it more accessible to service consumers who will be able to complete the information on their own devices, at a time that suits them. The system can replace the current ‘paper and pencil’ systems in place in many organisations. It is also adaptable to the existing processes of each provider organisation, integrating with a range of local third-party client information management systems (CIMS) via an Application Programming Interface (API). More information is available at the OMSSS REST API website: <a href="https://api.omsss.online/" target="_blank">https://api.omsss.online/</a></p>

<p>Subject to the permitted uses described below, the OMSSS can be used by PHNs and their commissioned provider organisations to collect any of the following outcome measures mandated in the PMHC MDS: Kessler 5 (K5), Kessler 10 Plus (K10+), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Additionally, the YES PHN survey can be collected through the OMSSS. Information about these measures can be found at: <a href="https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/" target="_blank">https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/</a></p>

<h6 id="12-how-does-omsss-work">1.2. How does OMSSS work?</h6>

<p>The OMSSS is accessed by clients of PHN-commissioned mental health services and used to enter outcome measures, for example the Kessler-10 Plus (K10+). The item scores are automatically totalled and made available to the PMHC MDS or the provider’s CIMS. It should be noted that the item scores and totals will only be uploaded into a provider’s CIMS if the CIMS have been integrated with the OMSSS using the API. The information can also be provided in a report to the relevant service provider. This automation reduces the administrative workload of clinical staff and minimises the chance of errors.</p>

<h6 id="14-features-and-benefits">1.4. Features and benefits</h6>

<p>Regular monitoring by service providers of client outcomes using standardised measures is critical to informing treatment decisions and ongoing dialogue between service providers and their clients. Reporting on client outcomes is a fundamental requirement of the PMHC MDS, and the OMSSS has been developed to support regular collection with the following features and benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enables clients to complete measures in their own time and on their own device which may
improve completion rates</li>
  <li>Provide greater insight into clients’ progress and the efficacy of treatments</li>
  <li>Flexibility for the OMSSS to be implemented in a way that suits the provider’s
ways of working and preferred approach to client completion of measures</li>
  <li>Flexibility regarding the treatment of completed questionnaires. Subscales
can be uploaded to the PMHC MDS, the provider’s own CIMS (if integrated
with the OMSSS using the API), and reports can be emailed directly to the
relevant practitioner</li>
  <li>Significant reduction in data entry for staff, and</li>
  <li>Automated scoring and integration with the PMHC MDS / CIMS reduce the risk
of data entry and scoring errors.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="licensing-arrangements-and-permitted-use">Licensing arrangements and permitted use</h5>

<p>PHNs and their commissioned Provider Organisations can use the OMSSS to collect the mandated outcome measures free of charge when the service provided to the client has been commissioned by the relevant PHN. At this stage, no other use of the OMSSS is permitted. A wider application of OMSSS in primary mental health care may be considered in the future.</p>

<h6 id="21-k10-and-k5">2.1. K10+ and K5</h6>

<p>Both the K10+ and K5 measures are in the public domain and may be used freely provided the author is properly referenced. Each of these measures is used widely throughout Australia with no restrictions on their incorporation in electronic data collection systems.</p>

<h6 id="22-sdq">2.2. SDQ</h6>

<p>The SDQ measures, authored by Dr Robert Goodman, are copyright protected with the UK-based Youthinmind organisation (<a href="https://youthinmind.com/" target="_blank">https://youthinmind.com/</a>). Specific conditions are attached to use of the SDQ measures, detailed at <a href="https://sdqinfo.org/" target="_blank">https://sdqinfo.org/</a>. These include the requirement that no modifications are made to the content in any way. Paper versions may be downloaded and copied without charge, subject to adherence to this condition.</p>

<p>The Australian Government Department of Health has entered into a licence agreement with Youthinmind to enable inclusion of the SDQ measures within the OMSSS. This enables PHNs and commissioned providers to use the electronic data collection, scoring and upload arrangements but only in the context of delivery of mental health care services that have been commissioned by PHNs. Further details in relation to licensed uses are described below.</p>

<p>The department is aware of a range of proprietary CIMS are in use by private practising providers and organisations in Australia. Any licensing agreement for use of the SDQ within these systems for purposes other than PMHC MDS collection and reporting is a matter that must be separately negotiated between the software owners and Youthinmind. Additionally, the department is aware that many individual Australian mental health practitioners make use of the functionality offered by Youthinmind, including MySDQ, SDQPlus and SDQScore. Responsibility for ensuring compliance with Youthinmind requirements for each of these functions rests with the individual practitioners and their parent organisations.</p>

<h5 id="3-yes-phn">3. YES PHN</h5>

<p>The YES PHN survey has now been included into the PMHC MDS data model and into the OMSSS. YES PHN data is not linked to client or episode records to adhere with the protocol for use and implementation of the YES PHN survey outlined in the guidance (available at <a href="https://www.amhocn.org/your-experience-service-surveys" target="_blank">https://www.amhocn.org/your-experience-service-surveys/</a>). This includes assurance to the client that the results are anonymous and administering organisations will not be able to identify both if their client has completed a YES PHN survey, or their scores.</p>

<h5 id="4-data-security-and-privacy">4. Data Security and Privacy</h5>

<p>Client privacy is critical. It is the responsibility of PHNs, service providers, and the department to ensure client information is managed appropriately and in accordance with respective obligations under legislation and the Australian Privacy Principles. Personal information of clients, and the results of their measures will be sent only to their health care provider. All entered data are communicated and stored in compliance with Australian privacy and data security legislation. This includes encrypting all information in transit and ensuring that only appropriate and approved people have access to that information.</p>

<p>The collection of client measures through the OMSSS as implemented by the PMHC MDS complies with the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles. Organisations utilising the OMSSS API to collect measures directly are responsible for ensuring appropriate privacy requirements are complied with.</p>

<p>Information is stored in OMSSS only while it is in use and for a limited time. Collection data can only be submitted up to 7 days after the record has been created and after a collection has been submitted. The results are only stored for a maximum of 7 days. All data except logs are automatically deleted after a period of 7 days, and can also be deleted earlier at the request of the integrator. Results pertaining to deleted data will be inaccessible after deletion, and the retained logs do not contain any personally identifying information.</p>

<p>For more about client consent and privacy, please visit <a href="https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/" target="_blank">https://pmhc-mds.com/resources/</a> and <a href="https://docs.omsss.online/en/latest/data-security-privacy.html" target="_blank">https://docs.omsss.online/en/latest/data-security-privacy.html</a></p>

<h5 id="attachment-a---guidance-on-information-for-clients">Attachment A - Guidance on Information for clients</h5>

<p>It is essential that clients are told about the reasons for the request and who the information is being requested by prior to receiving a request to complete an outcome measure through the OMSSS. When a collection is requested through the PMHC MDS, or a client email or SMS is provided to OMSSS when using the OMSSS API, the following wording will be used in the invitation that is sent to the client. Where a client email or SMS is not provided via the OMSSS API, the Department suggests the wording below as a basis for PHNs to use, or promote to commissioned providers to use, in informing clients. PHNs and service providers may vary the wording to suit their requirements, or embed them in existing client information documents they have prepared locally. The wording differs slightly depending on whether the measure selected is to be completed by the client about themselves (the K10+ and K5, SDQ for youth) or whether it completed by parents/guardians in respect of children under their care (SDQ for children).</p>

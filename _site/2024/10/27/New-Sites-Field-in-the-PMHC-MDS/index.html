        <p>The below circular was sent to PHN CEOs in October 2024.</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>

<p><strong>PHN CEO Circular October 2024</strong></p>

<h4 id="new-sites-field-in-the-pmhc-mds">New Sites Field in the PMHC MDS</h4>

<h5 id="overview-2024x10">Overview</h5>

<p>This circular is to inform you about an upcoming addition to the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) that will allow for data to be captured at a more granular level in cases where a provider organisation operates out of multiple sites within the same PHN.</p>

<p>This will be done by implementing a new data field called “sites” to the service contact record. The sites field will be available for all PHNs to use but is only a mandatory field for Medicare Mental Health Centres (MMHCs, formerly Head to Health) to enable more accurate routine program monitoring of these services.</p>

<p>To support the information in this circular, PHNs are asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure relevant staff receive and review the information on the new sites field.</li>
  <li>Share the guidance regarding the new sites field with relevant staff and service providers by 31 October 2024.</li>
  <li>Begin uploading to the PMHC MDS under v4.1 by 30 April 2025 before the v4.0 specification is phased out.</li>
  <li>Ensure all Medicare Mental Health Centres are named according to the guidance provided in this circular.</li>
</ul>

<p>For any questions regarding this information please contact <a href="mailto:MentalHealthData@health.gov.au">MentalHealthData@health.gov.au</a></p>

<h5 id="background-2024x10">Background</h5>

<p>Provision of information via the PMHC MDS is necessary for governments to undertake their role in funding, monitoring, and planning future national service delivery. The introduction of the new sites field aims to address the limitation that occurs when the same Provider Organisation (PO) is delivering services across multiple ‘sites’ within a PHN region. For each MMHC, a ‘site’ may be defined as a PO’s distinct service venue where there is more than one MMHC within the PHN region.</p>

<p>In 2023, the department consulted PHNs via the Head to Health Data Leads Community of Practice about the proposed new sites field in the PMHC MDS. Overall, the solution was supported. Some PHNs noted it could also be helpful for contract management and monitoring of other programs. At this stage, implementation of the new sites field is only mandatory for MMHCs.</p>

<p>For services that are not required to follow the MMHC naming guidance, a ‘site’ may be interpreted as a mechanism to differentiate activity occurring within a PO either physically, functionally, or contractually where PHNs feel this is the most appropriate way to record their data.</p>

<h5 id="addition-technical-details-2024x10">Additional Technical details</h5>

<p>If PHNs wish to begin system preparation in advance the draft specification is available at: <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/" target="_blank">Draft PMHC MDS Data Specification 4.1.0-Draft documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The sites field will be introduced with the release of PMHC MDS specification v4.1 which is anticipated to occur in November 2024. PHNs are encouraged to begin submitting data to v4.1 as soon as convenient but to allow for the transition v4.0 will not be decommissioned until April 2025. By this date, all PHNs and/or their service providers that upload to the PMHC MDS will need to upgrade to v4.1 before the v4.0 specification is phased out.</p>

<p>POs will have the ability to create sites for their organisation. Relevant staff may define the list of sites via upload or data entry. For data entry, the sites field will only be displayed on the Service Contact data entry form if there are sites defined for a PO. If there are sites defined for a PO, the service_contact_site field must be one of the defined sites of the PO. If there are no sites defined for a PO, the data entry form will not have any changes to how it currently appears for the v4.0 specification. The Logicly help desk is available to support PHNs with technical questions in relation to the implementation of the sites field.</p>

<p>The addition of the sites field does <em>not</em> apply to data submitted under the WayBack extension.</p>

<h5 id="naming-guidance-2024x10">Naming Guidance</h5>

<h6 id="mmhc-2024x10">MMHC</h6>

<p>POs should ensure that site names are clear and easily distinguishable from other MMHCs and services in their PHN region. To support accurate reporting and monitoring of service activity data through the PMHC MDS, it is recommended that the MMHC location is included in the site name (e.g., Townsville MMHC should include ‘Townsville’ somewhere in the site name such as TOWNSVILLE2024). Where a single MMHC is operating across more than one location, it is at the discretion of the PO whether to include this level of detail in the site name. PHNs can contact the Department <a href="mailto:MentalHealthData@health.gov.au">(MentalHealthData@health.gov.au)</a> to discuss individual requirements about implementing the MMHC naming guidance, as needed.</p>

<h6 id="other-2024-10">Other</h6>

<p>PHNs and POs who wish to utilise the sites field for services that are not delivered through MMHCs are requested to name sites in a reasonable and sensible way that maintains confidentiality for the relevant provider and complies with privacy legislation.   Logicly have updated the guidance available via the PMHC MDS data specification to include general naming guidance and validation requirements for the sites field: <a href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4.1/" target="_blank">Draft PMHC MDS Data Specification 4.1.0-Draft documentation</a>.</p>

<h5 id="naction-required-2024x10">Action Required</h5>

<p>The v4.1 specification is planned for release from 1 November 2024. PHNs will be notified through a system release e-mail notification from Logicly’s PMHC-MDS support service. Once released, PHNs will need to ensure that this information is distributed to relevant staff and service providers, and that their processes are updated accordingly.</p>

<p>PHNs are encouraged to begin submitting data under PMHC MDS specification v4.1 once it is released. For a 6-month period from the v4.1 release date, the PMHC MDS will still accept the v4.0 upload format before it is phased out.</p>

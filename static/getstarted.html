        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 1. Decide how to create upload files for the PMHC MDS</h4>
          <p>
            Before the PMHC MDS goes live, each PHN, in conjunction with their provider organisations,
            will need to analyse the data requirements and either organise to have their client management
            systems altered to produce the files required for upload or understand how to manually create
            the required Excel spreadsheets.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 2. Assign a primary contact</h4>
          <p>
            Before the PMHC MDS goes live each PHN needs to assign a primary contact.
            This is the person who will have overall responsibility for PMHC MDS data management
            within your PMHC.

            A letter of authority is a request made on your PHN or Non-Government Health Organisation's (NGHO) letterhead which must be signed by an authority at the PHN or NGHO who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the account is being created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).

            This letter must contain the following details for the primary contact:
            Name
            Email address
            Mobile phone number
            Title/Position

            This letter must be faxed to Strategic Data at (03) 9340 9090 or scanned then emailed to support@pmhc-mds.com

            An email address and a mobile phone number are required for security purposes and will be used when the user initially sets their password or needs to reset a forgotten password.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 3. Initial login</h4>
          <p>
            The PMHC MDS model allows PHNs to setup provider organisations underneath the PHN.

            When the primary contact user initially logs into the PMHC MDS they will need to create each of these provider organisations. The information required about each provider organisation is defined in the PMHC MDS specifications.

            At least one user within each provider organisation will also need to be created with the ‘Upload’ role so that provider organisations can upload data.

            The PMHC MDS allows flexibility in the way in which PHNs devolve authority to their provider organisations. In order to manage users a PMHC MDS user needs to be granted the ‘User Management’ role. The primary contact user will be granted this role and in turn they will be able to grant this role to any other user within their PHN or the PHN’s provider organisations.

            This means that PHNs can devolve user management authority to one or more users in a provider organisation so that the provider organisation can manage their own logins, or a PHN can choose to keep user management authority at the level of the PHN requiring each provider organisation to contact the PHN when they need a new user added.

            Once the primary user has set up the provider organisations and associated user accounts the PMHC MDS is ready for data upload. Separate data upload documentation will be available.

            Please contact support@pmhc-mds.com if you have any questions.

            Funding by the Australian Government Department of Health has been provided to Primary Health Networks (PHNs) through a Primary Mental Health Care flexible funding pool to support commissioning of mental health and suicide prevention services in six key service delivery areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              low intensity psychological interventions for people with, or at risk of, mild mental illness;
            </li>
            <li>
              psychological therapies delivered by mental health professionals to under serviced groups;
            </li>
            <li>
              early intervention services  for children and young people with, or at risk of mental illness;
            </li>
            <li>
              services for people with severe and complex mental illness who are being managed in a primary care setting;
              enhanced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health services; and
              a regional approach to suicide prevention activities with a focus on improved follow-up for people who have attempted suicide or are at high risk of suicide.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      <div class="step">
        <p>
          The Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) will provide the basis for monitoring and evaluation of these services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data reported by PHNs through the PMHC MDS will form the basis for production of key performance indicators used to monitor services delivered across the 31 PHN regions covered by PHNs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A draft specification of the data items to be collected in the PMHC MDS is available.
        </p>
